/**
 * A utility class for searching through all possible gluing permutation
 * sets that correspond to a given pentachoron facet pairing.  Subclasses of
 * Dim4GluingPermSearcher correspond to specialised (and heavily optimised)
 * search algorithms that may be used in sufficiently constrained scenarios.
 * The main class Dim4GluingPermSearcher offers a default (but slower) search
 * algorithm that may be used in more general contexts.
 *
 * The simplest way of performing a search through all possible gluing
 * permutations is by calling the static method findAllPerms().  This will
 * examine the search parameters and ensure that the best possible algorithm
 * is used.  For finer control over the program flow, the static method
 * bestSearcher() can be used to create a search manager of the most
 * suitable class and then runSearch() can be called on this object directly.
 * For absolute control, a specific algorithm can be forced by explicitly
 * constructing an object of the corresponding class (and again
 * calling runSearch() on that object directly).
 *
 * The search algorithm used by this base class employs modified
 * union-find structures for both triangle and edge equivalence classes to
 * prune searches that are guaranteed to lead to invalid triangles or edges.
 * This is a 4-dimensional analogue to the algorithms described in
 * "Enumeration of non-orientable 3-manifolds using face-pairing graphs and
 * union-find", Benjamin A. Burton, Discrete Comput. Geom. 38 (2007), no. 3,
 * 527--571.
 *
 * Note that this class derives from Dim4GluingPerms.  The search will
 * involve building and repeatedly modifying the inherited Dim4GluingPerms
 * data in-place.
