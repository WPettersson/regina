         *
         * 1. if the face is identified with itself under a non-identity
         *    permutation (e.g., an edge is identified with itself in
         *    reverse, or a triangle is identified with itself under a
         *    rotation);
         * 2. if the face does not have an appropriate link.  Here the
         *    meaning of "appropriate" depends upon the type of face:
         *    - for a face that belongs to some boundary facet(s) of the
         *      triangulation, its link must be a topological ball;
         *    - for a vertex that does not belong to any boundary facets,
         *      its link must be a closed (\a dim - 1)-manifold;
         *    - for a (\a subdim &ge; 1)-face that does not belong to any
         *      boundary facets, its link must be a topological sphere.
         *
         * Condition (1) is tested for all dimensions \a subdim and \a dim.
         * Condition (2) is more difficult, since it relies on undecidable
         * problems.  As a result, (2) is \e only tested when \a dim is one
         * of Regina's \ref stddim "standard dimensions".
         *
         * If this face is invalid, then it is possible to find out why.
         * In non-standard dimensions, this must mean that the face fails
         * condition (1) above.  In standard dimensions, you can call the
         * functions hasBadIdentification() and/or hasBadLink() to determine
         * whether the failure is due to conditions (1) or (2) respectively.
         *
         * @return for standard dimensions \a dim, returns \c true if and only
         * if this face is valid according to both conditions (1) and (2) above;
