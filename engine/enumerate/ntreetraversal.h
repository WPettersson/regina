/**
 * A base class for searches that employ the tree traversal algorithm for
 * enumerating and locating vertex normal surfaces and taut angle structures.
 * Users should not use this base class directly; instead use one of the
 * subclasses NTreeEnumeration (for enumerating all vertex normal surfaces),
 * NTautEnumeration (for enumerating all taut angle structures), or
 * NTreeSingleSoln (for locating a single non-trivial solution under
 * additional constraints, such as positive Euler characteristic).
 *
 * For normal surfaces, the full algorithms are described respectively in
 * "A tree traversal algorithm for decision problems in knot theory and
 * 3-manifold topology", Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica 65:4 (2013),
 * pp. 772-801, and "A fast branching algorithm for unknot recognition with
 * experimental polynomial-time behaviour", Burton and Ozlen, arXiv:1211.1079.
 *
 * This base class provides the infrastructure for the search tree, and the
 * subclasses handle the mechanics of the moving through the tree according
 * to the backtracking search.  The domination test is handled separately by
 * the class NTypeTrie, and the feasibility test is handled separately by the
 * class LPData.
 *
 * This class holds the particular state of the tree traversal
 * at any point in time, as described by the current \e level (indicating
 * our current depth in the search tree) and <i>type vector</i>
 * (indicating which branches of the search tree we have followed).
 * For details on these concepts, see the Algorithmica paper cited above.
 * The key details are summarised below; throughout this discussion
 * \a n represents the number of tetrahedra in the underlying triangulation.
 *
 * - In quadrilateral coordinates, the type vector is a sequence of \a n
 *   integers, each equal to 0, 1, 2 or 3, where the <i>i</i>th integer
 *   describes the choice of quadrilateral location in the <i>i</i>th
 *   tetrahedron.
 *
 * - In standard coordinates, the type vector begins with the \a n
 *   quadrilateral choices outlined above.  This is then followed by an
 *   additional 4<i>n</i> integers, each equal to 0 or 1; these
 *   correspond to the 4<i>n</i> triangle coordinates, and indicate
 *   whether each coordinate is zero or non-zero.
 *
 * - In angle structure coordinates, this class identifies taut angle
 *   structures only.  Here the type vector is a sequence of \a n integers,
 *   each equal to 1, 2 or 3, where the <i>i</i>th integer describes the
 *   location of the two &pi; angles in the <i>i</i>th tetrahedron.
 *
 * In the original Algorithmica paper, we choose types in the order
 * type_[0], type_[1] and so on, working from the root of the tree down
 * to the leaves.  Here we support a more flexible system: there is an
 * internal permutation \a typeOrder_, and we choose types in the order
 * type_[typeOrder_[0]], type_[typeOrder_[1]] and so on.  This
 * permutation may mix quadrilateral and triangle processing, and may
 * even change as the algorithm runs.
 *
 * This class can also support octagon types in almost normal surfaces.
 * However, we still do our linear programming in standard or quadrilateral
 * coordinates, where we represent an octagon using two conflicting 
 * quadrilaterals in the same tetrahedron (which meet the tetrahedron boundary
 * in the same set of arcs as a single octagon would).  As with the almost
 * normal coordinate systems in NNormalSurfaceList, we allow multiple octagons
 * of the same type, but only one octagon type in the entire tetrahedron.
 * In the type vector, octagons are indicated by setting a quadrilateral
 * type to 4, 5 or 6.
 *
 * There is optional support for adding extra linear constraints
 * (such as a constraint on Euler characteristic), supplied by the
 * template parameter \a LPConstraint.  If there are no additional
 * constraints, simply use the template parameter LPConstraintNone.
 *
 * Also, there is optional support for banning coordinates (i.e., insisting
 * that certain coordinates must be set to zero), and/or marking coordinates
 * (for normal and almost normal surfaces this affects what is meant by a
 * "non-trivial" surface for the NTreeSingleSoln algorithm; the concept of
 * marking may be expanded further in future versions of Regina).  These
 * options are supplied by the template parameter \a BanConstraint.
 * If there are no coordinates to ban or mark, simply use the template
 * parameter \a BanNone.
 *
 * In some cases, it is impossible to add the extra linear constraints
 * that we would like (for instance, if they require additional
 * preconditions on the underlying triangulation).  If this is a possibility
 * in your setting, you should call constraintsBroken() to test for this
 * once the NTreeTraversal object has been constructed.
 *
 * The template argument \a Integer indicates the integer type that
 * will be used throughout the underlying linear programming machinery.
 * Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, you should use the
 * arbitrary-precision NInteger class (in which integers can grow
 * arbitrarily large, and overflow can never occur).
 *
 * \pre The parameters LPConstraint and BanConstraint must be subclasses of
 * LPConstraintBase and BanConstraintBase respectively.  See the
 * LPConstraintBase and BanConstraintBase class notes for further details.
 *
 * \pre The default constructor for the template class Integer must intialise
 * each new integer to zero.  The classes NInteger and NNativeInteger,
 * for instance, have this property.
 *
 * \headers Parts of this template class are implemented in a separate header
 * (ntreetraversal-impl.h), which is not included automatically by this file.
 * Most end users should not need this extra header, since Regina's calculation
 * engine already includes explicit instantiations for common combinations of
 * template arguments.

/**
 * The main entry point for the tree traversal algorithm to enumerate all
 * vertex normal or almost normal surfaces in a 3-manifold triangulation.
 * For the analogous algorithm to enumerate taut angle structures, see the
 * class NTautEnumeration instead.
 *
 * This class essentially implements the algorithm from "A tree traversal
 * algorithm for decision problems in knot theory and 3-manifold topology",
 * Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica 65:4 (2013), pp. 772-801.
 *
 * To enumerate all vertex surfaces for a given 3-manifold
 * triangulation, simply construct a NTreeEnumeration object and call run().
 *
 * Alternatively, you can have more fine-grained control over the search.
 * Instead of calling run(), you can construct an NTreeEnumeration object and
 * repeatedly call next() to step through each vertex surface one at
 * a time.  This allows you to pause and resume the search as you please.
 *
 * If you simply wish to detect a single non-trivial solution under
 * additional constraints (such as positive Euler characteristic), then
 * use the class NTreeSingleSoln instead, which is optimised for this purpose.
 *
 * This tree traversal can only enumerate surfaces in quadrilateral normal
 * coordinates (NS_QUAD), standard normal coordinates (NS_STANDARD),
 * quadrilateral-octagon almost normal coordinates (NS_AN_QUAD_OCT), or
 * standard almost normal coordinates (NS_AN_STANDARD).  For almost
 * normal surfaces, we allow any number of octagons (including zero),
 * but we only allow at most one octagon \e type in the entire triangulation.
 * No coordinate systems other than these are supported.
 *
 * By using appropriate template parameters \a LPConstraint and/or
 * \a BanConstraint, it is possible to impose additional linear
 * constraints on the normal surface solution cone, and/or explicitly force
 * particular normal coordinates to zero.  In this case, the notion of
 * "vertex surface" is modified to mean a normal surface whose coordinates
 * lie on an extreme ray of the restricted solution cone under these additional
 * constraints (and whose coordinates are integers with no common divisor).
 * See the LPConstraintBase and BanConstraintBase class notes for
 * details.
 *
 * The template argument \a Integer indicates the integer type that
 * will be used throughout the underlying linear programming machinery.
 * Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, you should use the
 * arbitrary-precision NInteger class (in which integers can grow
 * arbitrarily large, and overflow can never occur).
 *
 * \pre The parameters LPConstraint and BanConstraint must be subclasses of
 * LPConstraintSubspace and BanConstraintBase respectively.  Note in
 * particular that the base class LPConstraintBase is not enough here.
 * See the LPConstraintBase, LPConstraintSubspace and BanConstraintBase
 * class notes for further details.
 *
 * \pre The default constructor for the template class Integer must intialise
 * each new integer to zero.  The classes NInteger and NNativeInteger,
 * for instance, have this property.
 *
 * \warning Although the tree traversal algorithm can run in standard
 * normal or almost normal coordinates, this is not recommended: it is likely
 * to be \e much slower than in quadrilateral or quadrilateral-octagon
 * coordinates respectively.  Instead you should enumerate vertex
 * solutions using quadrilateral or quadrilateral-octagon coordinates, and
 * then run the conversion procedure NNormalSurfaceList::quadToStandard()
 * or NNormalSurfaceList::quadOctToStandardAN().
 *
 * \headers Parts of this template class are implemented in a separate header
 * (ntreetraversal-impl.h), which is not included automatically by this file.
 * Most end users should not need this extra header, since Regina's calculation
 * engine already includes explicit instantiations for common combinations of
 * template arguments.

/**
 * The main entry point for the tree traversal / branching algorithm to locate
 * a single non-trivial normal surface satisfying given constraints within
 * a 3-manifold triangulation.  The constraints are passed using a
 * combination of the template arguments LPConstraint and BanConstraint.
 *
 * A common application of this algorithm is to find a surface of positive
 * Euler characteristic, using the template argument LPConstraintEuler.
 * This is useful for tasks such as 0-efficiency testing
 * and prime decomposition (when this is done in standard normal coordinates),
 * and also 3-sphere recognition (when this is done in standard almost normal
 * coordinates).  Indeed, the underlying algorithm is optimised for
 * precisely this application.
 *
 * By a "non-trivial" surface, we mean that at least one triangle coordinate
 * is zero.  Philosophically this is to avoid vertex linking surfaces,
 * though if the triangulation has more than one vertex then this takes
 * on a different meaning.  See the warning on this matter below.
 *
 * Be warned that this routine does not eliminate the zero vector, and so
 * the template argument LPConstraint should include at least one
 * constraint that eliminates the zero vector (e.g., positive Euler
 * characteristic).  Otherwise this algorithm may simply return the zero
 * vector, and the information gained will not be very useful.
 *
 * For any given normal coordinate, this routine will always try setting
 * that coordinate to zero before it tries setting it to non-zero.  In
 * other words, if it does find a surface satisfying the given constraints,
 * then it is guaranteed that the set of non-zero coordinate positions
 * will be minimal (though not necessary a global \e minimum).
 * In many settings (such as when using LPConstraintEuler), this guarantees
 * that the final surface (if it exists) will be a vertex normal or
 * almost normal surface.
 *
 * The underlying algorithm is described in "A fast branching algorithm for
 * unknot recognition with experimental polynomial-time behaviour",
 * Burton and Ozlen, arXiv:1211.1079, and uses significant material from
 * "A tree traversal algorithm for decision problems in knot theory and
 * 3-manifold topology", Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica 65:4 (2013),
 * pp. 772-801.
 *
 * To use this class, i.e., to locate a non-trivial normal or almost normal
 * surface under the given constraints or to prove that no such surface exists,
 * you can simply construct a NTreeSingleSoln object and call find().  You can
 * then call buildSurface() to extract the details of the surface that was
 * found.
 *
 * If you wish to enumerate \e all vertex surfaces in a 3-manifold
 * triangulation (instead of finding just one), you should use the class
 * NTreeEnumeration instead.
 *
 * This tree traversal can only enumerate surfaces in quadrilateral normal
 * coordinates (NS_QUAD), standard normal coordinates (NS_STANDARD),
 * quadrilateral-octagon almost normal coordinates (NS_AN_QUAD_OCT), or
 * standard almost normal coordinates (NS_AN_STANDARD).  For almost
 * normal surfaces, we allow any number of octagons (including zero),
 * but we only allow at most one octagon \e type in the entire triangulation.
 * No coordinate systems other than these are supported.
 *
 * The template argument \a Integer indicates the integer type that
 * will be used throughout the underlying linear programming machinery.
 * Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, you should use the
 * arbitrary-precision NInteger class (in which integers can grow
 * arbitrarily large, and overflow can never occur).
 *
 * \warning Typically one should only use this class with \e one-vertex
 * triangulations (since otherwise, setting at least one triangle coordinate
 * to zero is not enough to rule out trivial vertex linking surfaces).
 * Of course there may be settings in which multiple vertices make sense
 * (for instance, in ideal triangulations with multiple cusps, or when
 * using ban constraints), and in such settings this class will still work
 * precisely as described.
 * 
 * \warning If you examine the type vector (for instance, by calling
 * dumpTypes()), be aware that this class merges the old types 0 and 1
 * together into a single branch of the search tree.  This means that
 * type 0 never appears, and that type 1 could indicate \e either positive
 * quadrilaterals in the first position, or else no quadrilaterals at all.
 *
 * \pre The parameters LPConstraint and BanConstraint must be subclasses of
 * LPConstraintBase and BanConstraintBase respectively.  See the
 * LPConstraintBase and BanConstraintBase class notes for further details.
