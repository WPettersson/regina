/**
 * A matrix class for use with linear programming.
 *
 * This class is used in the tree traversal algorithms for enumerating
 * and locating vertex normal surfaces, as described in "A tree traversal
 * algorithm for decision problems in knot theory and 3-manifold topology",
 * Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica 65:4 (2013), pp. 772-801,
 * and "A fast branching algorithm for unknot recognition with
 * experimental polynomial-time behaviour", Burton and Ozlen, arXiv:1211.1079.
 * It is also used for locating a single strict angle structure, and for
 * enumerating all taut angle structures.
 *
 * The operations on this matrix class are tailored and optimised
 * specifically for use with the dual simplex method in the context
 * of a repetitive backtracking search.  As a result, the API is
 * cumbersome and highly specialised, which makes this matrix class
 * inappropriate for general use.
 *
 * It is \e critical that, before using such a matrix, you reserve space
 * for its elements, and then fix a specific size.  A matrix for which
 * both tasks have been done will be called \a initialised.  You can
 * initialise a matrix in one of two ways:
 *
 * - by using the (\a rows, \a columns) constructor, which does
 *   everything for you;
 *
 * - by using the default (no-arguments) constructor, then calling reserve(),
 *   and then calling one of the initialisation routines initClone() or
 *   initIdentity().
 *
 * You may call the initialisation initClone() and initIdentity() routines
 * more than once (e.g., during a backtracking search), and you may use
 * different matrix sizes each time.  However, you may never use more
 * elements than you originally reserved space for.
 *
 * This matrix is stored in dense form.  All elements are of the integer class
 * \a Integer, which is supplied as a template argument.
 *
 * \pre The default constructor for the template class Integer must intialise
 * each new integer to zero.  The classes NInteger and NNativeInteger,
 * for instance, have this property.
 *
 * \headers Parts of this template class are implemented in a separate header
 * (ntreelp-impl.h), which is not included automatically by this file.
 * Most end users should not need this extra header, since Regina's calculation
 * engine already includes explicit instantiations for common combinations of
 * template arguments.

/**
 * Stores an adjusted matrix of homogeneous linear matching equations based on

 *
 * This class forms part of the tree traversal algorithms for enumerating
 * and locating normal surfaces, as described in "A tree traversal algorithm
 * for decision problems in knot theory and 3-manifold topology",
 * Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica 65:4 (2013), pp. 772-801,
 * and "A fast branching algorithm for unknot recognition with
 * experimental polynomial-time behaviour", Burton and Ozlen, arXiv:1211.1079.
 * It is also used for locating a single strict angle structure, and for
 * enumerating all taut angle structures.
 *
 * The adjustments (which are all carried out in the LPInitialTableaux
 * class constructor) are as follows:
 *
 * - the rows of the matching equation matrix have been reordered so
 *   that the first rank() rows are full rank;

 * - the columns of the matching equation matrix have been reordered
 *   according to the permutation returned by columnPerm().  This is a
 *   heuristic reordering designed to improve the performance of the tree
 *   traversal algorithm; see columnPerm() for a list of constraints that
 *   such a reordering must satisfy.
 *
 * There is also optional support for adding extra linear constraints (such as
 * a constraint on Euler characteristic for normal surfaces).  These extra
 * constraints are supplied by the template parameter \a LPConstraint,
 * and will generate LPConstraint::nConstraints additional rows and columns
 * (used by the additional variables that evaluate the corresponding linear
 * functions).  If there are no additional constraints, simply use the
 * template parameter LPConstraintNone.
 *
 * In some cases, it may be impossible to add the extra linear constraints
 * that you would like (for instance, the constraints might require some
 * preconditions on the underlying triangulation that are not met).  If this
 * is a possibility in your setting, you should call constraintsBroken() to
 * test this as soon as the LPInitialTableaux has been constructed.  Even if
 * the constraints could not be added correctly, the tableaux will be left in a
 * consistent state (the constraints will just be treated as zero functions
 * instead).
 *
 * This class is optimised for working with \e columns of the matrix
 * (in particular, multiplying columns of this matrix by rows of some
 * other matrix).
 *
 * This class can only work in quadrilateral normal coordinates (NS_QUAD),
 * standard normal coordinates (NS_STANDARD), or angle structure coordinates
 * (NS_ANGLE).  No other coordinate systems are supported.
 *
 * \warning The implementation of this class relies on the fact that the
 * sum of <i>absolute values</i> of all coefficients in each column is
 * at most four (not counting the rows for any optional extra constraints).
 * If you are extending this class to work with more general matching
 * equation matrices, you may need to change the implementation accordingly.
 *
 * \pre The template parameter LPConstraint must be one of the subclasses of
 * LPConstraintBase.  See the LPConstraintBase class notes for further details.
 *
 * \headers Parts of this template class are implemented in a separate header
 * (ntreelp-impl.h), which is not included automatically by this file.
 * Most end users should not need this extra header, since Regina's calculation

         * to the number of tetrahedra in the underlying triangulation.
         *
         * - The quadrilateral coordinate columns must appear as the
         *   first 3<i>n</i> columns of the adjusted matrix.
         *   In particular, when working in the 7<i>n</i>-dimensional
         *   standard normal coordinate system, the remaining 4<i>n</i>
         *   triangle coordinate columns must appear last.
         *
         * - The quadrilateral coordinate columns must be grouped by
         *   tetrahedron and ordered by quadrilateral type.  In other
         *   words, for each \a i = 0,...,\a n-1, there will be some
         *   tetrahedron \a j for which the three columns
         *   3<i>i</i>, 3<i>i</i>+1 and 3<i>i</i>+2 refer to the
         *   quadrilaterals in tetrahedron \a j of types 0, 1 and 2
         *   respectively.  Phrased loosely, we are allowed to reorder
         *   the tetrahedra, but not the quadrilateral coordinates
         *   within each tetrahedron.
         *
         * - The triangle coordinate columns (if we are working in standard
         *   normal coordinates) must likewise be grouped by tetrahedron,
         *   and these tetrahedra must appear in the same order as for the
         *   quadrilateral types.  In other words, for each
         *   \a i = 0,...,\a n-1, the quadrilateral columns
         *   3<i>i</i>, 3<i>i</i>+1 and 3<i>i</i>+2 and the triangle columns
         *   3<i>n</i>+4<i>i</i>, 3<i>n</i>+4<i>i</i>+1, 3<i>n</i>+4<i>i</i>+2 
         *   and 3<i>n</i>+4<i>i</i>+3 all refer to the same tetrahedron.
         *
         * - For angle structure coordinates, the constraints are analogous to
         *   those for quadrilateral coordinates: the angle coordinates
         *   must be grouped by tetrahedron and ordered by angle type,
         *   and the final scaling coordinate must remain last.

/**
 * Stores an intermediate tableaux for the dual simplex method, and
 * contains all of the core machinery for using the dual simplex method.
 *
 * This class forms part of the tree traversal algorithms for enumerating
 * and locating normal surfaces, as described in "A tree traversal algorithm
 * for decision problems in knot theory and 3-manifold topology",
 * Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica 65:4 (2013), pp. 772-801,
 * and "A fast branching algorithm for unknot recognition with
 * experimental polynomial-time behaviour", Burton and Ozlen, arXiv:1211.1079.
 * It is also used for locating a single strict angle structure, and for
 * enumerating all taut angle structures.
 *
 * This class is designed to represent a state partway through the tree
 * traversal algorithm, where the tableaux has been altered to
 * constrain some variables:
 *
 * - Some variables have been "deactivated".  This means we fix them to
 *   zero permanently, and pretend that the corresponding columns do not
 *   exist in the matrix.  As a result, the rank of the matrix may
 *   smaller than it was when we began the tree traversal.
 *
 * - Some variables have been constrained to be positive; as described
 *   in Burton and Ozlen, it is safe to do this using the non-strict
 *   inequality x_i >= 1 (instead of the strict inequality x_i > 0, which
 *   is more difficult to enforce).  We enforce this constraing using a
 *   change of variable: we replace the variable x_i with (x_i - 1),
 *   which is then constrained to be non-negative as usual.  The new
 *   variable (x_i - 1) uses the same column in the tableaux (we perform
 *   the actual change of variable by editing the tableaux itself using
 *   column operations).  Be warned: as a result, when we arrive at a
 *   final solution and collect the values of the variables, we must
 *   remember to \e increment the values of any such variables by one.
 *
 * We do not store the full tableaux (which is dense and slow to work
 * with).  Instead we store the matrix of row operations that were
 * applied to the original starting tableaux (in the notation of Burton
 * and Ozlen, we store the matrix M_beta^{-1}, where M is the original
 * matrix stored in the class LPInitialTableaux, and beta is the current
 * basis).
 *
 * If the system is infeasible (because the constraints on variables as
 * described above are too severe), then the contents of the internal
 * data members are undefined (other than the data member \a feasible_,
 * which is guaranteed to be \c false).  This is because the code
 * is optimised to abort any operation as soon as infeasibility is detected,
 * which may leave the data members in a broken state.  If you are not sure,
 * you should always call isFeasible() before performing any other query
 * or operation on this tableaux.
 *
 * This class is designed to be used in a backtracking search, which
 * means the API is cumbersome but we can quickly rewrite and copy data.
 * The rules are as follows:
 *
 * - Before using an LPData object, you must reserve the necessary memory
 *   by calling reserve() and passing the original starting tableaux.
 *
 * - After this, you can reset the data by calling one of the initialisation
 *   routines initStart() or initClone(), and you can call these
 *   initialisation routines as often as you like.
 *
 * Like LPInitialTableaux, this class can enforce additional linear
 * constraints (such as positive Euler characteristic) through the template
 * parameter LPConstraint.  If there are no such constraints, simply use
 * the template parameter LPConstraintNone.
 *
 * In the context of normal surfaces (not angle structures):
 * Although the underlying coordinate system is based on quadrilaterals
 * and (optionally) triangles, this class has elementary support for
 * octagons also, as seen in \e almost normal surface theory.  For the
 * purposes of this class, an octagon is represented as a pair of
 * quadrilaterals of different types in the same tetrahedron: these meet
 * the boundary of the tetrahedron in the same arcs as a single octagon,
 * and therefore interact with the matching equations in the same way.
 *
 * To declare that you will be using octagons in some tetrahedron, you
 * must call constrainOct(quad1, quad2), where \a quad1 and \a quad2 are the
 * two corresponding quadrilateral columns.  This will have the following
 * effects, all of which may alter the tableaux:
 *
 * - There will be some changes of variable.  One of the two variables
 *   x_i will be replaced with (x_i - 1), forcing the number of octagons
 *   to be positive.  The other variable x_j will be replaced with
 *   (x_j - x_i), which will be set to zero and deactivated.  There is no
 *   guarantee as to which of the two variables \a quad1 and \a quad2
 *   will be kept and which will be deactivated: this will depend on the
 *   layout of the tableaux when constrainOct() is called.
 *
 * - If you are imposing additional constraints through the \a LPConstraint
 *   template parameter, the corresponding linear constraint functions
 *   may change their values (since the coefficients they use for
 *   octagon types need not be related to the coefficients for the two
 *   corresponding quadrilateral columns).  Any such changes are managed
 *   through the function LPConstraint::Coefficients::innerProductOct.
 *
 * This class has been optimised to ensure that you only have one
 * octagon type declared at any given time (which is consistent with the
 * constraints of almost normal surface theory).
 *
 * All tableaux elements are of the integer class \a Integer, which is
 * supplied as a template argument.  This same integer class will be
 * used as a template argument for \a LPConstraint.
 *
 * \pre The template parameter LPConstraint must be one of the subclasses of
 * LPConstraintBase.  See the LPConstraintBase class notes for further details.
 *
 * \pre The default constructor for the template class Integer must intialise
 * each new integer to zero.  The classes NInteger and NNativeInteger,
 * for instance, have this property.
 *
 * \headers Parts of this template class are implemented in a separate header
 * (ntreelp-impl.h), which is not included automatically by this file.
 * Most end users should not need this extra header, since Regina's calculation
 * engine already includes explicit instantiations for common combinations of
 * template arguments.
