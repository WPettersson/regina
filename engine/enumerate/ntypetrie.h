/**
 * A trie that stores a set of type vectors of a fixed length.
 *
 * This class forms part of the tree traversal algorithm for enumerating
 * vertex normal surfaces, as described in "A tree traversal algorithm
 * for decision problems in knot theory and 3-manifold topology",
 * Burton and Ozlen, Algorithmica 65:4 (2013), pp. 772-801.
 *
 * A type vector is a sequence of digits, each between 0 and \a nTypes-1
 * inclusive.  Type vectors are represented as arrays of characters:
 * these are not strings, but simply sequences of one-byte integers.
 * In particular, you cannot print them (since they use raw integer
 * values, not ASCII digits).  The length of a type vector must be
 * passed alongside it (i.e., there is no special terminating character).
 *
 * A type vector \a v is said to \e dominate \a u if, for each position
 * \a i, either v[i] == u[i] or else u[i] == 0.  So, for instance,
 * (1,0,2,3) dominates (1,0,2,0), which in turn dominates (1,0,0,0).
 * Domination is a partial order, not a total order: for instance,
 * neither of (1,0,2,0) or (1,0,3,0) dominates the other.
 *
 * We assume that all type vectors used in this trie have the same
 * length.  This is important, since we optimise the implementation by
 * ignoring trailing zeroes, which means that this trie cannot distinguish
 * between a vector \a v and the same vector with additional zeroes
 * appended to its end.
 *
 * Internally, each node of the trie is represented by a separate
 * NTypeTrie object, each of which is responsible for managing the
 * lifespan of its descendant nodes.  Externally, a user only needs
 * to create and manage a single NTypeTrie object (which becomes
 * the root of the trie).
 *
 * \pre \a nTypes is at most 256.  The typical value for \a nTypes for
 * normal surface enumeration is \a nTypes = 4.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present.
