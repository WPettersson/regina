         *
         * The precise form of the linear function(s) will typically

         * permutation that indicates which columns of the initial tableaux
         * correspond to which normal or angle structure coordinates.
         *
         * More precisely: recall that, for each linear function, the initial
         * tableaux acquires one new variable \a x_i that evaluates this linear
         * function f(x).  This routine must create the corresponding row that
         * sets <tt>f(x) - x_i = 0</tt>.  Thus it must construct the

         * coordinates, and it must also set a coefficient of -1 in the
         * column for the corresponding new variable.
         *
         * For each subclass \a S of LPConstraintBase, the array \a col
         * must be an array of objects of type LPCol<S>.
         * The class LPCol<S> is itself a larger subclass of
         * the Coefficients class.  This exact type must be used because the
         * compiler must know how large each column object is in
         * order to correct access each element of the given array.
         *
         * As described in the LPInitialTableaux class notes, it might
         * not be possible to construct the linear functions (since the
         * triangulation might not satisfy the necessary requirements).
         * In this case, this routine should ensure that the linear
         * functions are in fact the zero functions, and should return
         * \c false (but it must still set -1 coefficients for the new
         * variables as described above).  Otherwise (if the linear function
         * were successfully constructed) this routine should return \c true.
         *
         * If you are implementing this routine in a subclass that
         * works with angle structure coordinates, remember that your
         * linear constraints must not interact with the scaling coordinate
         * (the final angle structure coordinate that is used to projectivise
         * the angle structure polytope into a polyhedral cone).  Your
         * implementation of this routine \e must ensure that your
         * linear constraints all have coefficient zero in this column.

/**
 * A base class for additional banning and marking constraints that we
 * can place on tree traversal algorithms.  This is used with
 * NTreeEnumeration, NTreeSingleSoln and related algorithms for
 * enumerating and locating normal surfaces and angle structures in a
 * 3-manifold triangulation.
 *
 * This class adds constraints of two types:
 *
 * - \e Banning constraints, which ensure that certain coordinates
 *   are set to zero;
 *
 * - \e Marking constraints, which are more flexible and can be used in
 *   different ways by different algorithms.
 *
 * All of these constraints operate only on normal or angle structure
 * coordinates in the underlying tableaux (and in particular not the
 * additional variables introduced by additional linear constraints,
 * as described by LPConstraintBase and its subclasses).
 *
 * Currently marking is used in the following ways:
 *
 * - The NTreeEnumeration and NTautEnumeration algorithms do not use marking
 *   at all.
 *
 * - In the NTreeSingleSoln algorithm, marking affects what is considered
 *   a non-trivial normal surface.  Normally, a non-trivial surface is defined
 *   to be one in which some triangle coordinate is zero.  With marking,
 *   a non-trivial surface is redefined to be one in which some \e unmarked
 *   triangle coordinate is zero.  In other words, marked triangle types
 *   are effectively ignored when determining whether a surface is non-trivial
 *   or not.
 *
 * At present, marking is not used at all for quadrilateral coordinates
 * or angle structures.  However, marking is a very new feature, and this
 * concept may be expanded in future versions of Regina.
 *
 * This class does not record disc types in the order of their normal or
 * angle structure coordinates; instead it records them in the order of their
 * columns in a tableaux for linear programming (as used in LPInitialTableaux).
 * This means that there is a little more work required in setting up
 * the initial lists of banned and marked columns, but then these lists are
 * easy to use on the fly during tree traversal algorithms.
 *
 * This base class provides limited functionality (as documented below).
 * Subclasses \e must implement a constructor (which, like this base
 * class, takes a triangulation and a coordinate system), must implement
 * init() which determines which coordinates are banned and/or marked,
 * and must implement supported(), which indicates which normal or angle
 * structure coordinate system this constraint class can work with.
