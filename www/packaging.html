Currently the prebuilt packages on the download page are limited by the
hardware and disk space that I have access to.  This means that I can
only support a few distributions, and only on the i386 and amd64/x86_64
architectures.
<p>
If you are running on a different architecture (e.g., Sparc or PowerPC)
or you use a different distribution (e.g., Slackware or Gentoo) and
you're willing to help out with packaging, I'd <i>really</i> love to
hear from you.
<p>
What's involved?
<ul>
<li>If it's for a different version/architecture of a distribution
that already appears on the download page, it's quite possibly as easy
as taking the existing source package and rebuilding it on your machine.
For example, SuSE/ia64 or Fedora/ppc might fall into this category.</li>
<li>If it's for a distribution that is not yet offered for download,
it's probably a matter of taking the existing Debian / RPM packaging
files and massaging them for your distribution.  Often this is just a
matter of listing the correct build dependencies and passing the right
options to <i>cmake</i>.</li>
<li>If it's for something further removed from Linux/Unix (such
as Cygwin on MS&nbsp;Windows), there may be rather more fiddling about.
</ul>
<p>
Of course I'm happy to assist with the packaging and help diagnose
configure/build failures and the like.
My biggest problem at the moment is simply not
having access to the required hardware and build environments.
<p>
So: If you'd like to help out, please contact me at
<i>bab@debian.org</i> &ndash; I'd be very happy for your assistance!
