Version 4.94  [ (under development) ]

    ENGINE:
        Class Dim2Census, Dim2EdgePairing, Dim2GluingPerms,
                Dim2GluingPermSearcher:
            - New classes for building a census of 2-manifold triangulations.
        Class Dim2TriangleEdge:
            - New convenience typedef for NFacetSpec<2>.
        Class Dim2Triangulation:
            - New 2-manifold triangulation class.  This is a new packet
              type that can be independently stored in data files.
        Class Dim2BoundaryComponent, Dim2Component, Dim2Edge, Dim2EdgeEmbedding,
                  Dim2Isomorphism, Dim2Triangle, Dim2Vertex,
                  Dim2VertexEmbedding, NXMLDim2TriangulationReader:
            - New classes to support Dim2Triangulation.
        Class DimTraits:
            - New template class to assist with dimension-agnostic code.
        Class NAbelianGroup:
            - New convenience routines isZ() and isZn().
        Class NClosedPrimeMinSearcher, NCompactSearcher:
            - Improved the way in which cones and L(3,1) spines are
              detected and pruned during census enumeration.
            - Improved the way in which too many high degree edges are
              detected and pruned during census enumeration.
        Class NFacePairing:
            - Now derives from the template base class NGenericFacetPairing<3>.
            - Renamed getNumberOfTetrahedra() to size().  The old name
              is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.
        Class NGenericFacetPairing:
            - New template base class that contains dimension-agnostic
              code for representing face/facet pairings.
        Class NGenericIsomorphism:
            - New template base class that contains dimension-agnostic
              code for representing isomorphisms between triangulations.
        Class NIsomorphism:
            - Now a subclass of NGenericIsomorphism<3>, with inherited
              dimension-agnostic aliases for several routines.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - Made the destructor non-virtual to avoid the unwanted class
              overhead that comes with polymorphism.
            - Added constructor and assignment operator that take a
              reference to the new NLazyInteger class.
        Class NLazyInteger:
            - New fast class for finite arbitrary precision integer arithmetic.
              This class works with native C/C++ integers for as long as
              possible, and only switches to GMP large integers when it
              becomes unavoidable.
        Class NPacket:
            - Fix crash when sortChildren() is run on the root packet.
        Class NPerm3, NPerm4, NPerm5:
            - New dimension-agnostic alias Sn that refers to S3, S4 and S5 in
              NPerm3, NPerm4 and NPerm5 respectively.
            - New dimension-agnostic alias Sn_1 that refers to S2, S3 and S4 in
              NPerm3, NPerm4 and NPerm5 respectively.
            - New dimension-agnostic enum constants nPerms and nPerms_1 that
              contain the number of permutations in Sn and Sn_1 respectively.
            - New construtors that take an array of images.
            - NPerm3 and NPerm5 now have a copy of S2 (which NPerm4 already
              had).  Likewise, NPerm5 now has a copy of S3, orderedS3,
              S4 and orderedS4 (which NPerm4 again already had).
            - NPerm4::invS2 and NPerm4::invS3 are deprecated: the former
              is unnecessary, and the latter is identical to NPerm3::invS3.
            - NPerm3 now has a transposition constructor: NPerm3(a,b).
        Class NQitmask1, NQitmask2:
            - Fast classes for working with 0/1/2/3 "qits", i.e., "base 4 bits".
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - New dimension-agnostic aliases adjacentSimplex() and
              adjacentFacet().  These are identical to adjacentTetrahedron()
              and adjacentFace() respectively, and can help with
              writing code that works with more than one dimension.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routine drillEdge() to drill out a regular
              neighbourhood of an edge.
            - Rewrote barycentricSubdivision(): the code is now clearer,
              but note that the precise labelling of the new tetrahedra has
              changed from earlier versions of Regina.
            - New dimension-agnostic aliases getNumberOfSimplices(),
              getSimplices(), getSimplex(), simplexIndex(), newSimplex(),
              removeSimplex(), removeSimplexAt() and removeAllSimplices().
              These are identical to the corresponding routines for
              operating on tetrahedra, and can help with writing code that
              works with more than one dimension.
        Class NTritmask1, NTritmask2:
            - Fast classes for working with 0/1/2 trits, i.e., "ternary bits".
        Class NVertex:
            - New routine buildLink() to triangulate the vertex link.
        Typedef NFacePairingIsoList, UseFacePairing:
            - These typedefs have been renamed as NFacePairing::IsoList
              and NFacePairing::Use respectively.  The old typedefs are
              deprecated, and will be removed in some future release.
    UTILITIES:
        tricensus:
            - Now takes an optional argument -2/--dim2 to enumerate
              2-manifold triangulations.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added thorough tests for barycentric subdivision.
        - Added enumeration tests for Dim2EdgePairing.
        - Additional tests for facet pairing classes.
        - Additional tests for permutation databases Sk and orderedSk.

Version 4.93  [ 30 May, 2012 ]

    ENGINE:
        Class NAngleStructure:
            - New routine isVeering() to test for veering structures.
            - Flags (taut/strict/veering) are no longer stored in data files.
        Class NBlockedSFSLoop, NBlockedSFSTriple, NPluggedTorusBundle:
            - Corrected an off-by-one error in computing the genus of certain
              non-orientable base orbifolds for Seifert fibred pieces.
              This only affects census manifolds with >= 12 tetrahedra;
              in particular, no existing census data is affected.
        Class NExampleTriangulation:
            - New routine weeks() to build the Weeks manifold.
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - Routines isOrientable(), isTwoSided() and isConnected() now
              return bool instead of NTriBool.  This helps avoid unintended
              errors in scripts, but be warned: these properties can only be
              computed for compact surfaces (not spun normal surfaces).
            - Routines isIncompressible() and isCompressingDisc() likewise
              now return bool instead of NTriBool.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routines isSolidTorus() and knowsSolidTorus()
              for "one-click unknot recognition".
            - Routine hasCompressingDisc() now returns bool instead of NTriBool.
        Class NTriBool:
            - Deprecated.  This class has been replaced with ordinary (two-way)
              bool throughout Regina, and will be removed in a future release.
        Routine writeRecogniser():
            - Added to support sending triangulations to Matveev's
              3-manifold recogniser software.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Restored File -> Save and File ->Save As, which were missing from
          the main menu in version 4.92.
        - In the triangulation viewer, the old "Surfaces" tab has been renamed
          as the "Recognition" tab, and includes high-level algorithms such as
          3-sphere recognition as well as "opportunistic" combinatorial
          recognition.
        - Replaced the python icon with a generic terminal icon.
        - GUI python consoles now set the variable "item", not "selected".
          This is easier to type, and avoids the misconception that selecting
          a different packet in the tree might change the variable (which it
          doesn't).  The variable "selected" is also set for backward
          compability, though this will be removed in a future release.
        - GUI python consoles will now set item=None if there is
          nothing selected in the packet tree.
        - Simplified the cut/copy/paste behaviour in graphical Python consoles.
        - The knot/link census is now explicitly called the *hyperbolic*
          knot/link census, since non-hyperbolic knots or links are excluded.
    DOCUMENTATION:
        - Layout and navigation improvements in the user handbook.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added several tests related to Hakenness testing.

Version 4.92  [ 12 April, 2012 ] - The "hello Windows!" release.

    INSTALLATION:
        - Regina now builds and runs under Windows!
        - MacOS users now have a drag-and-drop app bundle, and do not
          need fink at runtime.
        - Linux (and indeed all) users no longer need KDE, since the user
          interface is now Qt-only.
    ENGINE:
        Class NBitmask:
            - Make NBitmask more suitable for use in containers.  Specifically,
              the assignment operator can now be used to initialise an
              uninitialised bitmask or to reset an already-initialised
              bitmask to a different length, and one or both of its
              operands may be invalid.
        Class NBitmask, NBitmask1, NBitmask2:
            - New function lessThan() for lexicographical comparisons.
        Class NDoubleDescription:
            - Removed the inner class LexComp, and replaced it with the new
              global class NPosOrder (see below).  A deprecated typedef
              NDoubleDescription::LexOrder is kept for backward compatibility.
        Class NFacePairing:
            - Function writeDot() can now optionally label graph
              vertices with the corresponding tetrahedron numbers.
            - Added graphviz export routines dot() and dotHeader(), which
              are like writeDot() and writeDotHeader() but return strings
              instead of writing to standard output.
        Class NFacetSpec:
            - New template class that generalises NTetFace to arbitrary
              dimensions.  NTetFace is retained as a convenience typedef,
              but with changes; see the NTetFace notes below.
        Class NGlobalDirs:
            - New routine setDirs() to be used when an application has
              been moved from the cmake-configured installation directory.
        Class NHilbertCD:
            - New class that implements a modified Contejean-Devie algorithm
              for Hilbert basis enumeration, based on the original algorithm in
              "An efficient incremental algorithm for solving systems of
              linear Diophantine equations", Contejean and Devie,
              Inform. and Comput. 113 (1994), 143-172.
        Class NHilbertDual:
            - New class that implements a modified dual algorithm for
              Hilbert basis enumeration, based on the dual algorithm in
              "Normaliz: Algorithms for affine monoids and rational cones",
              W. Bruns and B. Ichim, J. Algebra 324 (2010), 1098-1113.
        Class NHilbertPrimal:
            - New class that enumerates Hilbert bases by decomposing into
              maximal admissible faces and running the primal algorithm from
              Normaliz on each such face.  For details, see
              "Fundamental normal surfaces and the enumeration of Hilbert
              bases", B. Burton, arXiv:1111.7055, November 2011.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - Made separate constructors and assignment operators for
              arguments of type int, unsigned int, long, and unsigned long.
            - Added ++ and -- operators.
            - Added (long + NLargeInteger) and (long * NLargeInteger) operators.
            - New routines setRaw() and rawData() for interacting directly
              with libgmp and libgmpxx.
        Class NMaxAdmissible:
            - New class for enumerating maximal admissible faces of the
              normal surface solution cone.
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - New routine boundarySlopes() that calculates boundary slopes
              for spun normal surfaces.
            - New routines getOrientedTriangleCoord() and
              getOrientedQuadCoord() for transversely oriented normal surfaces.
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - New routines enumerateFundPrimal() and enumerateFundDual() to
              enumerate fundamental normal surfaces, as well as slower routines
              enumerateFundFullCone() and enumerateFundCD() for comparing
              different enumeration algorithms.
            - New coordinate systems ORIENTED and ORIENTED_QUAD to
              support transverse oriented normal surfaces.
            - New routines beginVectors() and endVectors() and new inner class
              VectorIterator for iterating through raw normal surface vectors.
            - New routine allowsOriented(), indicating whether the underlying
              coordinate system supports transverse orientations.
        Class NNormalSurfaceVector:
            - New routines getOrientedTriangleCoord() and
              getOrientedQuadCoord() for transversely oriented normal surfaces.
            - New routine allowsOriented(), indicating whether the underlying
              coordinate system supports transverse orientations.
        Class NNormalSurfaceVectorOriented, NNormalSurfaceVectorOrientedQuad:
            - New coordinate systems for transversely oriented normal surfaces.
        Class NPacket:
            - Fixed potential crash in fireDestructionEvent().
        Class NPerm3:
            - New routine compareWith() for sorting permutations.
        Class NPerm5:
            - New class describing permutations of five elements.
        Class NPosOrder:
            - Class for sorting hyperplanes during vertex enumeration.
              This is the new name for the old NDoubleDescription::LexComp.
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - New routine slopeEquations() that uses code from SnapPy to
              compute boundary slope matrices for cusps.
            - New routine verifyTriangulation() for ensuring that
              SnapPea has not retriangulated unexpectedly.
        Class NSurfaceSet:
            - New routine allowsOriented(), indicating whether the underlying
              coordinate system supports transverse orientations.
        Class NTetFace:
            - Now an instance of the arbitrary-dimension template class
              NFacetSpec.  NTetFace is retained as a typedef, but the fields
              have been renamed from tet/face to the more general simp/facet.
        Class XMLPropertyDict:
            - Removed the optional defaultVal argument from lookup();
              the default is now always the empty string.
        Routines perm4to5, perm5to4, perm3to4, perm4to3:
            - New routines for converting between permutation classes.
        Routine makeEmbeddedConstraints():
            - Added to help generate admissibility constraints based on a
              flavour constant, instead of an NNormalSurfaceVector subclass.
        Routines writeCSVStandard, writeCSVEdgeWeight:
            - Included boundary slopes of spun-normal surfaces in CSV output.
        Macro REGISTER_FLAVOUR:
            - Now requires an additional argument, indicating whether
              the coordinate system supports transverse orientations.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Ported from KDE to Qt-only.
        - Moved from a single monolithic window to lots of small windows
          (one for the tree, one for each open packets). The old
          interface can be re-enabled through Regina's preferences.
        - Continued the user interface overhaul, again with many more
          improvements that give cleaner and more sensible behaviour
          (too many changes to list individually).
        - Graphical Python consoles now execute "from regina import *"
          automatically.
    UTILITIES:
        regina-python:
            - Now executes "from regina import *" automatically.  You
              can suppress this with the argument --noautoimport.
            - For MacOS users: make sure 32-bit python is called when running
              32-bit fink on a 64-bit machine.
        tricensus:
            - Now outputs all face pairings as it runs, instead of periodic
              snapshots of where the census is up to.

Version 4.91: Internal development version.

Version 4.90  [ 12 September, 2011 ] - First prerelease for version 5.0.

    OVERALL:
        - The graphical user interface has been ported from KDE3 to KDE4.
        - The build system has been ported from autotools to cmake.
        - The built-in portions of the SnapPea kernel have been re-synced
          with the September 2009 version of SnapPea.
    DOCUMENTATION:
        - The users' handbook has undergone a thorough overhaul.  It is
          cleaner, more streamlined, and now full of screenshots.
        - The data file format has been split out of the users' handbook
          and placed in its own separate reference manual.
    ENGINE:
        Typedef AcceptTriangulation:
            - This global typedef has been deprecated.  Please use the
              class typedef NCensus::AcceptTriangulation instead.
        Class BitManipulator, GenericBitManipulator:
            - BitManipulator has new routines firstBit() and lastBit(), which
              return the positions of the first and last true bit respectively.
              This has required the addition of a new non-optimised base class
              GenericBitManipulator, which end users need never use directly.
        Class NAbelianGroup:
            - Routine addRank() now takes a signed integer, so that you
              can subtract from the rank as well as add to it.
            - Two new constructors to compute the homology of a chain complex
              with integer or mod-p coefficients.  Thanks to Ryan Budney.
        Class NAngleStructureList:
            - There is now an option to enumerate only taut angle structures,
              which is significantly faster than enumerating all vertex angle
              structures.  As a result, enumerate() now takes three arguments,
              there is a new routine isTautOnly(), and the data file format
              for angle structure lists contains a new element "angleparams".
            - Renamed allowsStrict() and allowsTaut() to spansStrict() and
              spansTaut().  The old routines are now deprecated but have been
              preserved (for now) for backward compatibility.
        Class NAngleStructureVector:
            - Removed clone().  Just use the copy constructor instead.
        Class NBitmask, NBitmask1, NBitmask2:
            - New operators ^= (XOR), -= (set difference) and = (assignment).
            - New routine truncate(), which truncates a bitmask to a given
              number of bits by setting all subsequent bits to zero.
            - New routines firstBit() and lastBit(), which return the
              positions of the first and last true bit respectively.
            - New convenience typedefs NBitmaskLen8, NBitmaskLen16,
              NBitmaskLen32 and NBitmaskLen64 for fast-and-small bitmasks
              of predetermined sizes.
        Class NCensus:
            - New class typedef NCensus::AcceptTriangulation to replace the
              old global typedef AcceptTriangulation.
        Class NDiscSetTetData:
            - Added assertions in data() to ensure that the given disc
              type and number are valid.  These can be circumvented by
              compiling with -DNDEBUG.
        Class NDoubleDescription:
            - Method enumerateExtremalRays() no longer has the "base" argument
              (which was used for cloning vectors); instead the method takes a
              new template argument specifying a vector class, and new vectors
              are created using the corresponding class constructors.
            - Improved the speed of adjacency testing by using an
              NTrieSet instead of a linear search through all vertices.
              See the NNormalSurfaceList notes below for further information.
            - Method enumerateExtremalRays() now takes an optional argument
              initialRows, allowing the user to force certain hyperplanes
              to be processed first.
        Class NExampleTriangulation:
            - New routine bingsHouse() returning the dual triangulation to
              Bing's house with two rooms.
            - Renamed seifertWeber() to weberSeifert(), for consistency with
              the original paper.  The old routine is now deprecated, but has
              being preserved (for the time being) for backward compatibility.
        Class NFacePairing:
            - Fixed the human-readable output for boundary faces in toString().
              Previously boundary faces were displayed as "n:0"; now they
              are displayed as "bdry".
        Class NFastRay:
            - Merged into the NRay class; see the NRay and NVector changes for
              details.  Because typedefs cannot be templated, there is no
              legacy typedef; instead NFastRay has been removed completely.
        Class NFastVector:
            - Merged into the NVector class; see the NVector changes for
              details.  Because typedefs cannot be templated, there is no
              legacy typedef; instead NFastVector has been removed completely.
        Class NGlobalDirs:
            - New routine data() to return the internal data directory.
        Class NGroupPresentation:
            - Fixed a memory leak in intelligentSimplify().
        Class NIsomorphism:
            - New routine applyInPlace() to directly modify a triangulation.
            - Routine apply() now copies tetrahedron descriptions as
              well as gluings (and so does the new routine applyInPlace()).
        Class NLayeredSurfaceBundle:
            - In isLayeredTorusBundle(), extend the search for possible
              cores to 11 and 12 tetrahedra.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - New routines randomBoundedByThis(), randomBinary() and
              randomCornerBinary() for pseudo-random number generation.
            - Faster (GMP-native) implementation of swap().
        Class NMarkedAbelianGroup, NHomMarkedAbelianGroup:
            - Both of these classes have much richer interfaces than before,
              and some old routines have now been deprecated.  See the class
              documentation for full details.  Thanks to Ryan Budney.
        Class NMarkedVector:
            - Added swap() to swap the contents of two vectors.
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - New routines isCompressingDisc() and isIncompressible() for
              testing incompressibility.
            - Fixed a memory leak in crush().
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - Sped up enumeration (again), this time by using a
              trie-like structure for adjacency testing.  For the
              Weber-Seifert space this improves speed threefold (roughly).
              Many thanks to Jonathan Shewchuk for encouraging me to
              focus on the adjacency testing bottleneck.
            - New filtering routines filterForLocallyCompatiblePairs() and
              filterForDisjointPairs().
            - New routine filterForPotentiallyIncompressible() to assist with
              bulk incompressibility testing; see arXiv:0909.4625 for details.
            - New routine allowsSpun() to easily identify coordinate systems
              that support spun normal surfaces.
        Class NNormalSurfaceVector:
            - Due to the changes in the NVector hierarchy, clone() is
              now introduced as a virtual function of NNormalSurfaceVector
              (not NVector), and it now returns an NNormalSurfaceVector*.
        Class NPacket:
            - In the python interface, makeOrphan() now returns the packet
              itself and the ownership becomes the responsibility of whoever
              takes this return value.  If nobody takes this return value
              then the packet and its descendants are automatically destroyed.
            - ChangeEventBlock has been renamed to ChangeEventSpan, it
              fires both packetToBeChanged() and packetWasChanged() (on
              construction and destruction respectively), and the
              optional boolean argument is gone (events are now fired always).
              The old class name ChangeEventBlock remains as a
              deprecated typedef for ChangeEventSpan.
            - The protected routine fireChangedEvent() has been removed.  The
              only way to fire a "packet changed" event now is to declare a
              local ChangeEventSpan.
        Class NPacketListener:
            - All events (except for destruction) now come with both future
              and past events: packetToBeChanged() and packetWasChanged(),
              childToBeAdded() and childrenWereAdded(), and so on.
        Class NPerm:
            - Renamed to NPerm4.  The C++ header has also moved from
              triangulation/nperm.h to maths/nperm4.h .  Both the old
              class name and the old header are now deprecated.
            - There are many other changes; see the NPerm4 notes below.
        Class NPerm3:
            - New class describing permutations of three elements.  This
              is extremely fast, using lookup tables for all calculations.
        Class NPerm4:
            - This is the new name for the old class NPerm (see above).
            - New routines S4Index() and orderedS4Index() for reverse
              lookups into the arrays NPerm4::S4 and NPerm4::orderedS4.
            - The constructor that takes an internal permutation code is
              now private, and is replaced by a new static routine
              NPerm4::fromPermCode().  This new routine is easier to
              spot and grep for.
            - The internal permutation codes have changed.  As a result,
              NPerm4 operations are significantly faster.  The old codes
              are now referred to as "first-generation", and the new codes
              are referred to as "second-generation".
            - Routines getPermCode(), setPermCode(), isPermCode() and
              fromPermCode() continue to refer to first-generation codes.
              These old routines are not recommended, since they now incur
              additional overhead.  To replace them, the new (and faster)
              routines getPermCode2(), setPermCode2(), isPermCode2() and
              fromPermCode2() work with second-generation codes instead.
            - The XML data file format continues to use first-generation
              permutation codes (for backward compatibility).
        Class NRational:
            - New STL-compatible routine swap().
        Class NRay:
            - Like the vector hierarchy, NFastRay and NRay are now merged
              into a single NRay class.  The result is that NRay is now
              cleaner and faster, but methods are no longer virtual.
              See the NVector class notes for full details of the changes
              (including important changes in the parent NVector class).
            - Removed the old intersect() function, which was based on
              virtual methods.
        Class NScript:
            - Fixed a bug that lost script variables when reading ancient
              binary files (i.e., files created before Regina 3.0, around
              mid-2002).  This bug only showed up on some compilers.
        Class NSnapPeaCensusManifold, NSnapPeaCensusTri:
            - Routines getHomologyH1() (for both classes) and construct()
              (for NSnapPeaCensusManifold) are now implemented for all SnapPea
              census manifolds/triangulations, not just the smallest few.
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Kernel messages are now disabled by default.
        Class NSurfaceSet, NSurfaceSubset:
            - New routine allowsSpun() to easily identify coordinate systems
              that support spun normal surfaces.
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - Tetrahedra should now always belong to a triangulation, from
              creation until destruction.  In particular:
              + Tetrahedra should be created by calling
                NTriangulation::newTetrahedron(), which will insert them
                into a triangulation immediately.  There is no need to
                call NTriangulation::addTetrahedron() any more.
              + NTetrahedron::joinTo() now recursively adds adjacent
                tetrahedra to the relevant triangulation (but if you use
                NTriangulation::newTetrahedron() as described above then
                this is fast and changes nothing).
            - Users no longer need to call NTriangulation::gluingsHaveChanged()
              after gluing or ungluing tetrahedron faces; this is now handled
              automatically.
            - The NTetrahedron constructors are now deprecated in favour
              of NTriangulation::newTetrahedron(), as described above.
            - New routine getVertexMapping(), which facilitates a
              consistent orientation around the given vertex for the
              three remaining vertices in each tetrahedron.
            - Added assertions in joinTo() and unjoin() to ensure that
              the preconditions are met.  These can be circumvented by
              compiling with -DNDEBUG.
            - Routines that need the triangulation skeleton (e.g., getVertex(),
              getEdgeMapping(), orientation(), etc.) will now compute the
              skeleton automatically if this has not already been done.
            - New routine getTriangulation() to return the enclosing
              triangulation.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Add new routines newTetrahedron() and
              newTetrahedron(const std::string&).  This is now the
              preferred way of creating tetrahedra (see the NTetrahedron
              notes above).  The old addTetrahedron() is now deprecated.
            - Users no longer need to call gluingsHaveChanged(), which
              is likewise deprecated.  Again, see the NTetrahedron notes above.
            - Routines removeTetrahedron() and removeTetrahedronAt() now
              destroy the tetrahedron immediately and return nothing.
            - New routines hasCompressingDisc() and hasSimpleCompressingDisc()
              to search for compressing discs; see arXiv:0909.4625 for details.
            - The "legality conditions" on closeBook() are now simpler, since
              some of the conditions were automatic consequences of others.
              Practically, nothing has changed (i.e., the new conditions will
              be satisfied if and only if the old conditions were satisfied).
            - The "legality conditions" on twoOneMove() were originally too
              conservative, and are now weaker.  In particular, the endpoints
              of the edge may now both be boundary.  Practically, this means
              that 2-1 moves may now be legal where they were not legal before.
            - New static routine rehydrate() to rehydrate a new triangulation
              from a Callahan-Hildebrand-Weeks dehydration string.  This is a
              more convenient version of insertRehydration().
            - New routines isoSig() and fromIsoSig() for detecting and hashing
              combinatorial isomorphism classes of triangulations.
            - New routines isOriented() and orient() to relabel tetrahedron
              vertices for consistent orientation.  Thanks to Matthias Goerner.
            - New routines isOrdered() and order() to relabel tetrahedron
              vertices so that they are ordered consistently across adjacent
              faces.  Thanks again to Matthias Goerner.
            - New routines swapContents() and moveContentsTo() for
              moving tetrahedra between triangulations.
            - Fixed a memory leak in shellBoundary().
        Class NTrieSet:
            - A new class for storing and querying a large number of sets,
              where the elements of these sets are taken from a small universe.
              The underlying data structure is essentially a trie of bitmasks.
        Class NVector:
            - Streamlined the vector hierarchy by merging NFastVector and
              NVectorDense into a single NVector class, and removing NVectorUnit
              and NVectorMatrix entirely.  The result is that NVector
              is now cleaner and faster, but methods are no longer virtual.
              See the NVector class notes for full details of the changes.
            - Removed the old virtual clone() and makeLinComb() methods.
        Class NVectorDense:
            - Merged into the NVector class; see the NVector changes for
              details.  Because typedefs cannot be templated, there is no
              legacy typedef; instead NFastVector has been removed completely.
        Class NVectorMatrix, NVectorUnit:
            - Removed.  Use NVector instead.
        Class NVertexEmbedding:
            - New routine getVertices(), which facilitates a consistent
              orientation for the three remaining vertices in each tetrahedron.
        Class XMLPropertyDict:
            - The interface for this class is now much more restricted.
              The class now derives from std::map instead of stdhash::hash_map,
              and it allows access to only a few inherited members of std::map.
        Routine metricalSmithNormalForm():
            - New alternative Smith normal form routine that is better for
              working with extremely large matrices.  Thanks to Ryan Budney.
        Routine readIsoSigList():
            - New routine that reads a text file filled with isomorphism
              signatures and returns a container filled with triangulations.
        Routine readSnapPea():
            - Allows additional text on the first line following the
              "% Triangulation" marker (thanks to Matthias Goerner).
        Routine torsionAutInverse():
            - New routine for inverting automorphisms, thanks to Ryan Budney.
        Routines writeCSVStandard(), writeCSVEdgeWeight():
            - Changed the text that is written to the "boundary" field,
              to be consistent with changes to the user interface.
              Possible values are now "spun", "real" or "none".
        File surfaces/flavourregistry.h:
            - The final "pre_test" argument (which is never used) has been
              removed.  As a result, REGISTER_FLAVOUR now takes five arguments,
              not six.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Ported from KDE3 to KDE4.  Finally!
        - The user interface has had a thorough overhaul, and includes
          many usability updates to help new users find their way around.
          Overall, the behaviour is generally cleaner and more sensible.
          A full list of changes is omitted for reasons of space and sanity.
        - There is now an option to enable or disable diagnostic
          messages from the SnapPea kernel.
    UTILITIES:
        tricensus, tricensus-mpi:
            - New option -s to output lists of isomorphism signatures instead
              of the much larger Regina data files.
        tricensus-mpi-status:
            - Now finishes with a running total of all triangulations found.
            - Compressed logs (using gzip or bzip2) are now supported.
              Requires the perl module IO::Uncompress::AnyUncompress.
        tricensus-manager:
            - Removed, since tricensus-mpi is a much better alternative.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Some slower but more detailed tests are now optional, and are
          disabled by default.  To switch these tests on, set the
          environment variable REGINA_DETAILED_TESTS to any non-empty value.
        - New tests for file I/O using both modern XML and legacy binary
          file formats.
        - More detailed tests for bitmask operations.
    BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
        - Dropped support for ancient hacks like std::ios::no_create and
          the boost.python make_constructor hack.
        - Iconv is now mandatory, not optional.

Version 4.6  [ 16 May, 2009 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Deprecated everything relating to the non-standard STL/g++ classes
          hash_set and hash_map, for the sake of portability.
        - Added a "deprecation guide" to the website, with a table listing
          the outdated routines/classes/etc. to be removed in Regina 5.0 and
          the corresponding new routines/classes/etc. that replace them.
    ENGINE:
        Class HashPointer, HashString:
            - Deprecated, along with everything else relating to the hash_set
              and hash_map classes.  See the "overall" notes above.
        Class NBoundaryComponent, NComponent, NEdge, NFace, NVertex:
            - All constructors for skeletal objects are now private, since
              only the triangulation skeletal routines should be creating them.
            - Cleaned up some of the more obscure parts of the documentation.
        Class NCensus:
            - Removed findAllCompletions(), which (as the documentation
              points out) is an empty shell of a routine that has never been
              implemented and quite possibly never will.
        Class NDiscType:
            - New class for specifying a normal or almost normal disc type.
        Class NDoubleDescription, NDoubleDescriptor:
            - The old NDoubleDescriptor class has been renamed, and is now
              called NDoubleDescription.  This is merely for consistency
              with documentation and papers; the functionality of the class
              has not changed.  The old name (NDoubleDescriptor) is
              deprecated, but for the time being a typedef is provided
              for backward compatibility.
        Class NEdge:
            - Added new static arrays NEdge::edgeNumber and NEdge::edgeVertex
              to replace the old global arrays regina::edgeNumber,
              regina::edgeStart end regina::edgeEnd.  The old global
              arrays are now deprecated (see below).
            - Added a new static array NEdge::ordering to replace the old
              global routine regina::edgeOrdering().  The old routine is
              now deprecated (see below).
        Class NFace:
            - Added a new static array NFace::ordering to replace the old
              global routine regina::faceOrdering().  The old routine is
              now deprecated (see below).
        Class NFacePairing:
            - Added a missing precondition to isCanonical(), which requires
              that the face pairing be connected.
            - Changed the output format of toString() to make it clearer
              which faces are boundary faces.
        Class NFastRay:
            - New fast but inflexible ray class; this builds on NFastVector
              in the same way that the slower NRay builds on NVector.
        Class NGluingPermSearcher, NCompactSearcher, NClosedPrimeMinSearcher:
            - Overhauled the census code so that some of the optimisations
              used in the closed minimal irreducible / P^2-irreducible census
              can be made available to more general censuses.  In particular,
              the modified union-find for vertex and edge links is now
              available to any census that insists on compact (finite)
              3-manifolds.  For details of these optimisations, see
              "Enumeration of non-orientable 3-manifolds using face-pairing
              graphs and union-find", B. A. Burton, Discrete Comput. Geom. 38
              (2007), no. 3, 527--571.
        Class NIndexedArray:
            - Deprecated, along with everything else relating to the hash_set
              and hash_map classes.  For a replacement, try the NMarkedVector
              class, which is smaller and faster but requires modification
              of the data type being stored.
        Class NIsomorphism, NIsomorphismDirect, NIsomorphismIndexed:
            - NIsomorphism has been enhanced to add all of the functionality
              of the old NIsomorphismDirect class, so NIsomorphism is now a
              fully-fledged isomorphism class in its own right.
            - NIsomorhpismDirect has been deprecated, since this is now an
              empty subclass of NIsomorphism with no extra functionality.
              Programmers can change their code to use NIsomorphism instead.
            - NIsomorphismIndexed has been removed entirely.  Python users
              will not be affected, since this class was never available to
              them.  C++ programmers can now use NIsomorphism in conjunction
              with the NPerm::S4 array instead.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - The old header utilities/nmpi.h is now deprecated.  Please use
              the new header maths/nlargeinteger.h instead.
        Class NMatrix2:
            - The old header utilities/nmatrix2.h is now deprecated.  Please
              use the new header maths/nmatrix2.h instead.
        Class NNormalSurface:
            - Finally implemented cutAlong()!
            - New routine isEmpty() for identifying empty surfaces.
            - New routine sameSurface() for comparing two normal surfaces.
            - New routines locallyCompatible() and disjoint() for testing
              intersections between normal surfaces.
            - New routine getOctPosition() for locating the non-zero
              octagonal coordinate in an almost normal surface.
            - New routine rawVector() that gives direct read-only access to
              the underlying vector in case this is needed.
            - Removed canCrush() and knownCanCrush(), which are both
              placeholders for routines that have never been implemented.
              The corresponding <cancrush> element has been removed from
              the data file format (though old files that happen to contain
              it will load without problems).
            - Added an optional argument to findVtxOctAlmostNormalSphere()
              that lets the user choose between working in standard and
              quadrilateral-octagon coordinates.
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - Implemented quadrilateral-octagon coordinates for almost normal
              surfaces (the relevant flavour constant is AN_QUAD_OCT).
              See arXiv:0904.3041 for details.
            - Added routines quadToStandard(), standardToQuad(),
              quadOctToStandardAN() and standardANToQuadOct() to convert
              between different solution sets.  See arXiv:0901.2629 for
              details of the underlying algorithms.
            - Changed enumerate() in standard coordinates so that, if
              possible, it enumerates in quadrilateral coordinates first
              and then converts between solution sets (see above).  This
              typically runs orders of magnitude faster.  Similarly for
              standard almost normal coordinates.
            - New routines enumerateStandardDirect() and
              enumerateStandardANDirect() to allow people to circumvent the
              above changes to enumerate() and instead use the old direct
              enumeration from Regina 4.5.1.
            - Almost normal surface enumeration no longer strips out surfaces
              with more than one octagonal *disc* (though it still avoids
              surfaces with more than one octagonal disc *type*).  This
              change is necessary for conversion between quad-oct and
              standard almost normal space, and is also necessary if we
              wish to enumerate *all* almost normal surfaces (as opposed
              to just all *vertex* almost normal surfaces).
            - Added a new coordinate flavour AN_LEGACY to reflect almost
              normal surface lists created with Regina 4.5.1 or earlier,
              where surfaces with more than one octagon were stripped out
              (see above).
        Class NPerm:
            - New routines trunc2() and trunc3() to build a truncated
              version of a permutation string.
            - New arrays NPerm::S4, NPerm::invS4, NPerm::orderedS4,
              NPerm::S3, NPerm::invS3, NPerm::orderedS3, NPerm::S2 and
              NPerm::invS2.  These replace the old (and now deprecated)
              arrays regina::allPermsS4, regina::allPermsS4Inv,
              regina::orderedPermsS4, and so on.
            - Deprecated the setPerm() routines; these are unnecessary
              because NPerm objects are very small and can just be copied
              around using the assignment operator.
        Class NPermItS4:
            - Deprecated, since all this class does is wrap a trivial loop.
              Just loop through the elements of NPerm::S4 directly.
        Class NPillowTwoSphere, NSnappedTwoSphere:
            - Removed reduceTriangulation() and getReducedTriangulation(),
              both of which are empty shells of routines that have never
              been implemented and quite possibly never will.
        Class NRational:
            - Added new routines getTeX() and writeTeX() for TeX-friendly
              output (thanks Ryan!).
            - The old header utilities/nrational.h is now deprecated.  Please
              use the new header maths/nrational.h instead.
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - Renamed getAdjacentTetrahedron(), getAdjacentTetrahedronGluing()
              and getAdjacentFace() to adjacentTetrahedron(), adjacentGluing()
              and adjacentFace(), which should be easier on the fingers.
              The old names are still available for backward compatibility,
              but they are now deprecated and will be removed in Regina 5.0.
            - Proofreading and clarification for some of the older and more
              opaque parts of the documentation.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routines isBall() and knowsBall() for recognising the
              3-dimensional ball.
            - New elementary move closeBook().
            - Completely overhauled collapseEdge().  The eligiblity checks for
              this routine are now correct and not overly conservative, which
              makes this routine both useful and safe.  The big warning is
              now gone from the collapseEdge() documentation as a result.
            - Routine simplifyToLocalMinimum() now collapses edges, which
              makes a big difference for multiple-vertex triangulations.
            - Routine intelligentSimplify() now uses book opening moves to
              create new opportunities for collapsing edges (which makes a
              big difference for bounded triangulations), and also uses
              book closing moves to reduce the number of boundary faces
              once nothing else can be done.
            - Routine isThreeSphere() now works in quadrilateral-octagon
              coordinates instead of standard almost normal coordinates.
              See arXiv:0904.3041 for details.
            - Removed crushMaximalForest(), which (as the documentation has
              pointed out since the first release) has never worked properly,
              and which is therefore never actually used.
            - Fixed crashes in twoOneMove(), twoZeroMove(NVertex*, ...)
              and shellBoundary().  These crashes were triggered by certain
              types of non-minimal triangulations with boundary.
            - Fixed a couple of nasty bugs in shellBoundary(), which had the
              potential to give incorrect results when simplifying
              triangulations with boundary.
            - Fixed bugs in several simplification routines when working
              with invalid triangulations; these sometimes "simplified"
              invalid edges to become valid edges.
            - New routine reorderTetrahedraBFS() for renumbering tetrahedra
              in a more sensible fashion.
            - Routines isZeroEfficient() and hasSplittingSurface() now
              operate on a clone of the triangulation, to avoid triggering
              changes to the packet tree.
        Routine edgeOrdering(), faceOrdering():
            - Deprecated these routines, in favour of the new NEdge::ordering[]
              and NFace::ordering[] lookup tables.
        Routine edgeDescription(), faceDescription():
            - Deprecated these routines, in favour of the new NPerm::trunc2()
              and NPerm::trunc3() routines.
        Routine writeResUsage():
            - New helper routine to assist with diagnostics and measurements
              of performance.
        Global arrays allPermsS4, allPermsS4Inv, orderedPermsS4, allPermsS3,
                allPermsS3Inv, orderedPermsS3, allPermsS2, allPermsS2Inv:
            - All of these arrays are now deprecated.  Please use the new
              arrays NPerm::S4, NPerm::invS4, NPerm::orderedS4, and so on.
        Global arrays edgeNumber, edgeStart, edgeEnd:
            - Deprecated; users are advised to switch to the new arrays
              NEdge::edgeNumber and NEdge::edgeVertex instead.
        Namespace stdhash:
            - Deprecated, along with everything else relating to the hash_set
              and hash_map classes.  See the "overall" notes above.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - The elementary moves dialog now has additional "Close book"
          and "Collapse edge" options.
        - Items in the triangulation composition list can now be copied
          into the clipboard via the right mouse button.  Amongst other
          things, this makes extracting the dehydration string much simpler.
        - In the triangulation viewer, the Surfaces panel now has a new
          "3-ball?" entry beneath the current "3-sphere?" entry.
        - The normal surface list viewer now has two additional tabs: one to
          summarise all surfaces in the list (which is now the default tab),
          and one to list pairwise compatibilities between surfaces.
        - The normal surface list viewer now has an additional "Cut Along"
          menu item.  The shortcut letter for "Crush" has changed as well.
        - Warn the user before enumerating immersed and/or singular normal
          surfaces, in case the "embedded surfaces only" box was unchecked
          by accident.  Moreover, refuse to enumerate immersed and/or
          singular *almost* normal surfaces, since this feature was designed
          for use with normal surfaces only.
        - The surface coordinate viewer now lists the location of the almost
          normal disc(s) alongside the other high-level surface properties.
        - Normal surfaces are now individually numbered within surface lists,
          which should make it easier to keep track of which is which.
        - Added "Troubleshooting" and "Handbook won't open?" entries to
          the Help menu, to make it easier to find solutions if things break.
        - The "Python Reference" entry in the Help menu should now work
          even when konqueror is not installed.
        - Fixed a bug whereby small triangulations occasionally became
          read-only after a user visited the Surfaces panel.
        - Added a scrollbar to the Cellular Info pane in case the window
          is small.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added very thorough tests for NPerm.
        - Additional tests for triangulation simplification and Euler
          characteristic.
        - New tests for the recognition of families of standard triangulations
          and manifolds.
        - New tests that enumerate automorphisms of triangulations and
          test for subcomplexes.
        - Added exhaustive testing for 3-sphere and 3-ball recognition.
        - Added exhaustive testing for conversions between normal surface
          solution sets in different coordinate systems.
    BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
        - Installing into a staging area (i.e., building packages) now works
          fine even if older versions of the Regina development libraries are
          installed (this used to cause relinking problems on some systems).

Version 4.5.1  [ 28 October, 2008 ]

    CENSUS:
        - Replaced the old plain-text Notation packets with detailed PDF
          packets in the closed orientable / non-orientable censuses.
          These new Notation packets explain the manifold names and
          parameters precisely, and include supporting diagrams.
        - Renamed some census manifolds to avoid arbitrary (a), (b) suffixes.
          In the 11-tetrahedron closed orientable census:
            Hyp_2.13401634 (Z_14) (a)  ->  Hyp_2.13401634 (Z_14, geod = 0.4606)
            Hyp_2.13401634 (Z_14) (b)  ->  Hyp_2.13401634 (Z_14, geod = 0.3684)
            (These have also been reordered in the overall list of manifolds.)
          In the 11-tetrahedron closed non-orientable census:
            SFS [M] U m003 (a)  ->  SFS [M] U m003 (Z + Z_5)
            SFS [M] U m003 (b)  ->  SFS [M] U m003 (Z + Z_10)
          These changes are only stop-gaps until hyperbolic manfiolds are
          dealt with properly (i.e., expect the names to change again).
    ENGINE:
        Class NBitmask, NBitmask1, NBitmask2, BitManipulator:
            - New classes for manipulating bitmasks.  NBitmask is for bitmasks
              of arbitrary length, whereas NBitmask1 and NBitmask2 are
              optimised for situations where the length is known to be small.
              BitManipulator makes it easier to offer optimised template
              specialisations.
        Class NCompConstraint, NCompConstraintSet:
            - Removed.  Compatibility constraints now refer to facets of
              the original cone, not coordinate positions (hence the
              rename, since the semantics have changed in a fundamental way).
              Individual compatibility constraints are now straight sets of
              integers, and the deque-based NCompConstraintSet has been
              replaced with the new vector-based class NEnumConstraintList.
        Class NDoubleDescriptor:
            - Streamlined the vertex enumeration routine, which is now
              much, much faster.  See arXiv:0808.4050 for a full list of
              improvements.
            - The vertex enumeration routine now takes its arguments in
              a different form, and more importantly now insists that
              the original cone is in fact the non-negative orthant.
              To ensure that python/C++ users notice that things have changed,
              this routine has been renamed from enumerateVertices() to
              enumerateExtremalRays().
            - Major overhaul of the documentation, which is now (hopefully)
              much clearer.
        Class NEnumConstraintList:
            - Added to replace the old NCompConstraintSet class.  See
              the notes above on NCompConstraintSet for details.
        Class NFastVector:
            - New vector class that is less flexible than NVector but
              more streamlined, largely because it has no virtual functions.
        Class NGraphTriple:
            - Fixed a bug in writeTeXName() that listed incorrect entries for
              the first matrix.  This does not affect any census data that
              has been published or shipped with earlier versions of Regina.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - Fixed lcm() to do the right thing in the case of lcm(0,0).
        Class NMatrixInt:
            - New integer-specific routines divRowExact(), divColExact(),
              gcdRow(), gcdCol(), reduceRow() and reduceCol().
        Class NMatrixField:
            - Removed this class, since it is never used and since it does not
              actively address the accuracy problems raised by real numbers.
        Class NNormalSurfaceVector:
            - Removed createNonNegativeCone() from subclasses (which is
              no longer required after the vertex enumeration overhaul),
              and added makeZeroVector() (which is now required).
        Class NPDF:
            - A new packet type that allows PDF documents to be stored
              directly as packets inside Regina data files.
        Routines base64Length(), isBase64(), base64Encode(), base64Decode():
            - New routines for base64 encoding and decoding, taken and
              modified from the gnulib library.
        Routines createNonNegativeCone(), makeZeroVector():
            - Removed global routine createNonNegativeCone() and replaced it
              with the new global makeZeroVector(), in line with the changes
              to NNormalSurfaceVector listed above.
        Routine gcd():
            - Now takes longs instead of unsigned longs, and guarantees
              that the gcd returned will be non-negative.
        Routine lcm():
            - Added to the collection of basic number theory routines.
        Routines readPDF(), writePDF():
            - New routines for importing and exporting PDF packets to
              real PDF files.
        Routines rowBasis(), rowBasisAndOrthComp():
            - Added to find the rank of an integer matrix and bases for its
              row space and orthogonal complement.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - PDF documents can now be embedded within data files as PDF packets.
          Added import, export and creation facilities, plus a PDF packet
          viewer that uses either an embedded KPart (such as kpdf or
          kghostview's embedded viewer) or an external application (such
          as xpdf or evince) according to the user's preferences.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added new tests for normal surfaces that exploit generic properties
          of layered loops; these tests push to 50 tetrahedra, and can
          easily be extended further as surface enumeration becomes faster.
        - Added additional tests for normal surfaces and angle strutures
          that compare solutions coordinate by coordinate (instead of
          counting solutions and looking for large-scale properties).

Version 4.5  [ 17 May, 2008 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Regina finally pays attention to character encodings:
            + All strings in the calculation engine are assumed to be UTF-8,
              except for filenames which should be in whatever local encoding
              the operating system expects.
            + Regina's XML data files store their data in UTF-8, as does the
              python configuration file ~/.regina-libs.
            + The various user interfaces ensure that the correct character
              encodings are always used, and translate between encodings
              where required.
            + Users who pass strings directly to the calculation engine
              (through the python or C++ interface) must ensure that
              their strings are either UTF-8 or just plain ASCII.
        - Builds under gcc 4.3.
        - Supports building out-of-tree (e.g., making separate builds in
          debug/ and release/ subdirectories).
    ENGINE:
        Class Locale, IConvBuffer, IConvStream:
            - New classes in the regina::i18n namespace for working with
              internationalisation and character encodings.
        Class NExampleTriangulation:
            - New routine seifertWeber() to build the Seifert-Weber
              dodecahedral space.
        Class NFileInfo:
            - Made the XML identification routines more robust, so that
              they work even if extra parameters (such as encoding or
              standalone declarations) are present in the XML prologue.
        Class NGlobalDirs:
            - New class for easy access to system installation directories
              for various components of Regina.
        Class NMarkedVector, NMarkedElement:
            - New class for a vector with fast reverse lookups.  This
              is more memory efficient than NIndexedArray, but requires
              modifications to the data type being stored.
        Class NPacket, NPacketListener:
            - Fires packetWasRenamed() when packet tags are added or removed.
              Note that packet tags still cannot be accessed through the GUI
              except for via the python bindings.
            - Made the event handling code more robust; this fixes a
              couple of crashes in the GUI that occured when packets were
              deleted from the tree while they were still in use elsewhere.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Streamlined the implementation, cutting ~ 1/3 of the memory
              usage and improving speed also.  As a result:
                + Tetrahedra and skeletal components are now stored using
                  NMarkedVector, not NIndexedArray.  As a result the return
                  types of getTetrahedra(), getVertices(), etc. have changed.
                + The old reverse lookup routines getTetrahedronIndex(),
                  getVertexIndex(), etc. are now deprecated.  The new routines
                  tetrahedronIndex(), vertexIndex(), etc. are even faster,
                  but have new preconditions requiring the given tetrahedron,
                  vertex, etc. to belong to the triangulation.
        Class NXMLElementReader:
            - New routine usingParser() that passes the current parser to the
              top-level element reader.
        Class XMLParserCallback:
            - Callback routine start_document() now takes a single argument
              that points to the current XMLParser.
        Routine readXMLFile(), readFileMagic():
            - Assumes that any Regina data files created by version 4.4 or
              earlier use a LATIN-1 encoding (which is what the old GUI used
              by default), and that any data files created by version 4.5 or
              later use UTF-8.
        Routine versionUsesUTF8():
            - Added to assist code that works with files on a low-level basis.
        Routines writeCSVStandard(), writeCSVEdgeWeight():
            - New routines for exporting normal surface lists to plain-text
              CSV files (which can then be imported into a spreadsheet or
              database).
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Normal surface lists can now be exported to plain-text CSV files
          (which can then be imported into a spreadsheet or database).
        - The default SnapPea filename filter is now *.tri instead of just *.
        - Several imports and exports (e.g., to/from python scripts and C++
          source) now allow the user to select an explicit character encoding.
        - Added the Seifert-Weber dodecahedral space to the list of example
          triangulations that can be created.
        - When adding a new library in Regina's python settings, the file
          dialog now opens in the pylib/ directory where sample libraries
          are installed.
        - Application icons are now listed under hicolor instead of crystalsvg,
          which should make them easier for other desktop environments to find.
    PYTHON:
        - Use docstrings for the helper routines in pylib/, so documentation
          for these routines can be accessed from within python at runtime.
        - Added loadCensus.py as a new collection of optional helper routines
          in pylib/.  These make it easy to load census data files from within
          python.
    UTILITIES:
        regfiledump, trisetcmp:
            - Now respects the default locale; any international characters
              in packet labels or packet contents are displayed using the
              correct character set (e.g., LATIN-1 for Western European users).

Version 4.4  [ 25 November, 2007 ] - The "hug a Mac today" release.

    OVERALL:
        - Builds and runs happily on MacOS!  Requires Fink to be installed.
        - Tidied up the directory hierarchy a little.  The old engine/engine/
          is now just engine/, and the old engine/doc-files/ is now
          engine/doxygen/.
        - Thanks to Ryan Budney for his many contributions to this release!
    CENSUS:
        - Expanded the closed non-orientable census to 11 tetrahedra.
        - Expanded the closed orientable census to 11 tetrahedra, and
          split it into three data files.  The 9-tetrahedron and
          10-tetrahedron files are shipped with Regina as before (as
          closed-or-census.rga and closed-or-census-large.rga); the
          11-tetrahedron file is extremely large and must be downloaded
          separately from the Regina website.
        - Modified the closed orientable census files to use more
          consistent choices of monodromy matrices for torus bundles.
        - Clarified the matrix notation used with graph manifolds.
    ENGINE:
        Class NClosedPrimeMinSearcher:
            - Census generation is much faster for larger numbers of
              tetrahedra, due to new tests for high-genus vertex links.
            - Also made census generation more efficient by pruning on
              high-degree edges (as well as the usual low-degree edges).
        Class NDoubleDescriptor:
            - Now a standalone class, since the base NVertexEnumerator
              has been removed.
            - Made all member functions static.  Objects of this class
              can no longer be created.
        Class NFacePairing:
            - Modified writeDot() to behave well with ancient versions
              of Graphviz.
        Class NHomologicalData:
            - New class for computing all sorts of detailed homological
              information for a manifold; thanks to Ryan Budney for this.
        Class NLargeInteger:
            - New routine divisionAlg() for using the division algorithm.
            - New routine legendre() for calculating Legendre symbols.
        Class NMatrix:
            - New == and != operators for element-by-element comparison.
        Class NMatrixInt:
            - Added a set() routine to the python interface for setting
              matrix elements (which was previously not possible in python).
            - Made matrix multiplication available in the python interface.
            - Added a python-only variant of initialise() that fills a
              matrix given a complete list of elements.
        Class NMatrixRing:
            - New routine det() for fast calculation of matrix determinants.
            - New convenience routine isIdentity().
            - Changed the return type of operator * from a raw pointer to a
              std::auto_ptr, to make it easier to multiply matrices inside
              temporary expressions.
            - Added a new multiplyAs() template routine that multiplies but
              (unlike operator *) returns a subclass of NMatrixRing.
        Class NMarkedAbelianGroup, NHomMarkedAbelianGroup:
            - New classes for working with groups defined by chain
              complexes; thanks to Ryan Budney for these.
        Class NPacket:
            - New routine reparent() to simplify ownership issues when
              using Python scripting.
        Class NPerm:
            - Micro-optimised routines that are called extremely frequently,
              such as sign().
        Class NPrimes:
            - New class that provides a more sophisticated infrastructure
              for prime factorisation than the old factorise() and
              primesUpTo() routines.
        Class NRational:
            - New routine abs() for calculating absolute value.
            - New routine doubleApprox() for converting to a real number.
        Struct NSatAnnulus:
            - New routine attachLST() to help with Seifert fibred spaces.
        Class NSFSpace:
            - Updated reduce() to make the best possible decisions on
              whether to reflect all fibres in cases where this is
              possible (previously it made faster decisions but
              occasionally missed some more subtle reductions).
            - Enhanced construct() to support the triangulation of all
              Seifert fibred spaces over the 2-sphere without punctures
              or reflector boundaries.
        Class NTetrahedron:
            - New routine orientation() for tracking orientation.
        Class NTorusBundle:
            - Greatly improved monodromy matrix reduction, to the point
              where equivalent torus bundles should give equal matrices.
            - Fixed a bug in the matrix reduction for non-symmetric
              matrices in non-orientable manifolds (sometimes the
              transpose matrix was obtained instead of the correct matrix).
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routine layerOn() for performing layerings.
            - New routine dehydrate() for extracting Callahan-Hildebrand-Weeks
              dehydration strings.
            - Optimised the skeletal calculations, which now run *much* faster.
            - Renamed getEulerCharacteristic() to getEulerCharTri(), since for
              ideal triangulations this differs from the Euler characteristic
              of the corresponding compact manifold.  The old name is kept as
              an alias but is now deprecated.
            - Added a new routine getEulerCharManifold(), which *does* calculate
              the Euler characteristic of the corresponding compact manifold.
            - Fixed a crash in splitIntoComponents() that occurred when
              the triangulation skeleton had not yet been calculated.
        Class NVertexEnumerator:
            - Removed.  This abstract class existed to support multiple
              vertex enumeration algorithms, but in reality we're only
              using double descriptor anyway.  The virtual template
              member functions caused problems with g++-4.2, which was
              the final push.  NDoubleDescriptor is now a standalone class.
        Routine smithNormalForm():
            - New five-argument version that not only calculates the Smith
              normal form but also returns appropriate change of basis
              matrices; thanks to Ryan Budney.
        Routines columnEchelonForm() and preImageOfLattice():
            - New routines for working with matrices and homomorphisms;
              thanks again to Ryan Bydney.
        Routines factorise(), primesUpTo():
            - Deprecated in favour of routines from the new NPrimes class.
        Routine clonePtr():
            - New routine to assist copy constructors for classes that
              compute data on demand.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - New Algebra -> Cellular Info tab containing a variety of new
          homological data for triangulations; thanks to Ryan Budney.
        - Graphs now look better when drawn using an old Graphviz 1.x
          (previously the graphs were only tested under Graphviz 2.x).
        - Better infrastructure for determining the status of the
          current Graphviz installation.  For version 1.x, Regina now
          insists on using dot, since the old neato 1.x cannot handle
          multiple edges.
        - Removed the Crush column from normal surface lists, since it has
          never contained any information beyond "N/A" or "Unknown".
        - The Regina reference manual is now called the Regina handbook,
          for consistency with other KDE applications.
    PYTHON:
        - The regina-python tool has new options -i/--interactive (run a
          script and leave the interpreter open) and -n/--nolibs (do not
          load any of the normal user libraries).
    UTILITIES:
        trisetcmp:
            - Now outputs more appropriate messages when subcomplex testing
              (previously the same messages were used for both subcomplex
              testing and isomorphism testing).
    TEST SUITE:
        - Added a new test suite for python bindings, in addition to the
          usual C++ test suite that is already present.
        - Added tests for the NPerm class.
        - Added tests for vertex link calculations.
        - Added tests for the orientable double cover of a triangulation.
        - Added tests for the new NPrimes class.
        - Added division algorithm tests for NLargeInteger.
        - Added tests for the new NHomologicalData class.
        - Added tests for triangulation dehydrations and rehydrations.
        - Initial work on tests for the NRational class.
    BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
        - Updated libtool from version 1.5a to 1.5.22 with Debian patches
          (required for MacOS support).

Version 4.3.1  [ 5 May, 2006 ]

    ENGINE:
        Class NClosedPrimeMinSearcher:
            - Improved speed by adding additional face pairing graph
              tests; see math.GT/0604584 for details.
            - Made a very slight improvement in speed by testing for
              extremely high degree edges.
            - Fixed memory leak (the destructor was not deallocating some
              internal arrays).
            - Minor changes to the behaviour of mergeEdgeClasses()
              (might return only some flags instead of all flags).
        Class NFacePairing:
            - New constructor for building the face pairing of an
              existing triangulation.
            - New routines hasOneEndedChainWithStrayBigon() and
              hasTripleOneEndedChain() for testing for more types of
              graphs that cannot appear in a closed census.
            - New routines hasSingleStar(), hasDoubleStar() and
              hasDoubleSquare() for investigating larger face pairing graphs.
            - New routines writeDot() and writeDotHeader() to assist
              with graph visualisation.
        Routine readOrb():
            - New routine for importing Orb / Casson triangulations;
              thanks to Ryan Budney for contributing this import filter.
        Routine readSnapPea():
            - Verifies that the first line of the file is "% Triangulation",
              instead of simply testing for the '%' and ignoring the rest.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Now displays face pairing graphs in the triangulation viewer, using
          Graphviz for the rendering (see the Skeleton tab).  This required
          splitting the main Skeleton tab into two smaller child tabs.
        - New configuration options for the Graphviz executable and the
          default Skeleton child tab.
        - No longer crashes when attempting to clone the root packet
          (it simply displays an error message instead).
        - Added a workaround for the icon problems that arise when using
          GNU/Linux distributions with buggy icon themes.
        - Added 48x48 and 64x64 icons for Regina and its data files.
    TEST SUITE:
        - New tests for recognising bad and otherwise interesting subgraphs
          within face pairing graphs.

Version 4.3  [ 27 March, 2006 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Expanded the closed non-orientable census to 10 tetrahedra.
        - Expanded the closed orientable census to 10 tetrahedra, and
          split it into two data files (large and small).
        - Updated postal address for the Free Software Foundation.
        - Bibliographic updates for the reference manual.
        - Fixed some harmless compiler warnings, and tightened syntax
          to adhere to the requirements of gcc 4.1.
    ENGINE:
        Class LessDeref:
            - New utility class for working with pointers in the Standard
              Template Library.
        Class NGluingPerms, NGluingPermSearcher, NClosedPrimeMinSearcher:
            - Significant overhaul.
            - Moved gluing permutation search routines into new classes
              NGluingPermSearcher and NClosedPrimeMinSearcher.
            - Supports partial depth-based searching (by passing a
              non-negative depth parameter to the new runSearch() routine).
            - Tracks both vertex and edge links using a modified union
              find structure to prune more braches of the search tree
              where possible.  This makes an incredible difference to the
              census running time.  Pruning takes place on non-orientable
              vertex links, too many or too few vertices or edges, low
              degree or invalid edges, conical faces, and L(3,1) spines.
        Class NGraphLoop, NGraphPair, NGraphTriple:
            - New families of graph manifolds.
        Class NKnot:
            - Removed this unwritten placeholder class.
        Class NLayering:
            - New class to help follow through layerings of tetrahedra
              within a triangulation.
        Class NLayeredSolidTorus:
            - New routine formsLayeredSolidTorusTop() for finding an LST
              from the top end instead of the bottom.
            - New routine transform() for following through an isomorphism.
        Class NLayeredTorusBundle, NTxICore, NTxIDiagonalCore, NTxIParallelCore:
            - Added for recognition of layered surface bundles.
        Class NListOnCall:
            - New class for expensive and rarely used hard-coded lists.
        Class NManifold:
            - Routine writeTeXName() no longer provides wrapping dollar signs.
            - New operator < for ordering manifolds deterministically.
        Class NMatrix2:
            - New specialised class for working with 2-by-2 integer matrices.
        Class NPacket, NPacketListener:
            - New NPacket routine sortChildren().
            - Packet listeners are now unregistered immediately *before*
              packetToBeDestroyed() is called.  This avoids unpleasantries
              when a listener tries to unregister itself during this call.
        Class NPerm:
            - The assignment operator now returns a reference instead of void.
        Class NSatAnnulus, NSatBlock, NSatRegion, NBlockedSFS, NBlockedSFSLoop,
                  NBlockedSFSPair, NBlockedSFSTriple, NPluggedTorusBundle,
                  plus subclasses and other support structures:
            - New classes for recognising and describing Seifert fibred spaces
              and other graph manifolds that are built using saturated blocks.
        Class NSFS, NExceptionalFibre:
            - Removed; see below.
        Class NSFSpace, NSFSFibre:
            - Complete overhaul of the Seifert fibred space classes.
            - Now more general, supporting both orientable and
              non-orientable 3-manifolds as well as base orbifolds with
              reflector boundary components.
            - Classes have been renamed from the old NSFS / NExceptionalFibre
              to make it clear that large-scale changes have taken place.
        Class NSFSAltSet:
            - New class for finding alternative simple representations of
              the same bounded Seifert fibred space.
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Added a boolean argument to the constructor that permits the
              SnapPea kernel to work with closed triangulations if the user
              really wants to allow it.
        Class NStandardTri:
            - Routine writeTeXName() no longer provides wrapping dollar signs.
        Class NTorusBundle:
            - New class of 3-manifolds describing torus bundles over the
              circle.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Combined isomorphism and subcomplex testing routines into
              a single all-in-one routine to avoid excessive code reuse.
            - Added new subcomplex testing routine findAllSubcomplexesIn(),
              in which all matches (not just the first) are returned.
            - Routines getTetrahedronIndex(), getComponentIndex(),
              getBoundaryComponentIndex(), getFaceIndex(), getEdgeIndex()
              and getVertexIndex() now returned signed instead of unsigned
              longs, so that -1 can be returned if the object could not
              be found.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Added a configuration option that allows the SnapPea kernel to
          work with closed triangulations.
        - Fixed the crash when deleting a triangulation that is currently the
          target of an isomorphism/subcomplex test.
        - Fixed a crash that sometimes occurs in large files when deleting
          a triangulation that is currently being viewed.
        - Fixed extremely slow updates in the triangulation composition tab
          for very large data files.
        - Text and script packets now open with the cursor at the top
          instead of the bottom.
    PYTHON:
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Offers the additional zero-argument routine volumeWithPrecision()
              as a way of returning the precision of the volume calculation.
    UTILITIES:
        tricensus-mpi:
            - Significant overhaul.
            - Now supports finer-grained subsearches via --depth.
            - Better logging.
            - Only writes .rga data files for cases in which at least
              one triangulation was found.
            - New option --dryrun for a quick overview of the search space.
        tricensus-mpi-status:
            - New tool for parsing tricensus-mpi logs.
        trisetcmp:
            - Support subcomplex testing as well as isomorphism testing.
    TEST SUITE:
        - Don't enforce precision limits for degenerate snappea volume
          testing, to allow for flexibility in floating point behaviours
          of different chipsets.
        - Added tests for NIsomorphism.

Version 4.2.1  [ 18 September, 2005 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Added a chapter on imports and exports to the reference manual.
        - Expanded the closed non-orientable census to eight tetrahedra.
    ENGINE:
        Overall structure:
            - Fixed "regina-engine-config --cflags", which wrote includes
              for Regina's dependencies but not for Regina itself (sigh).
        Class NIsomorphism:
            - New routine random() for generating random isomorphisms.
            - New routine apply() for permuting the tetrahedra and
              vertices/faces of an existing triangulation.
            - New routine isIdentity() for testing for identity isomorphisms.
        Routine writeSnapPea():
            - Add a precondition that the triangulation has no boundary faces.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Refuse to export a triangulation to SnapPea format if it
          has boundary faces.
    UTILITIES:
        trisetcmp:
            - New utility for comparing two different sets of triangulations.

Version 4.2  [ 7 July, 2005 ]

    ENGINE:
        Overall structure:
            - Included portions of the SnapPea kernel!  Thanks again to
              Jeff Weeks for his support.
            - Added a regina-engine-config script to make it easier to
              build Regina's calculation engine into other applications.
        Class NExampleTriangulation:
            - Added to facilitate construction of several different
              ready-made sample triangulations.
        Class NFacePairing:
            - New routine hasWedgedDoubleEndedChain.
        Class NLayeredSolidTorus:
            - New routine isLayeredSolidTorus for classifying an entire
              triangulation component.
        Class NPacketListener:
            - Added an extra boolean argument to childWasRemoved() to indicate
              the situation in which the parent is also being destroyed.
        Class NSnapPeaCensusManifold, NSnapPeaCensusTri:
            - Added to aid recognition of very small SnapPea census
              triangulations.
        Class NSnapPeaTriangulation:
            - Added to give Regina triangulations access to the SnapPea kernel.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - New routine finiteToIdeal() for extending a triangulation.
            - New routines insertConstruction() and dumpConstruction() to
              make it easier to hard-code triangulations in source code.
            - Fixed vertex link calculations, which were previously
              incorrect if a triangulation contained invalid edges.
            - Fixed bug in twoZeroMove() which caused a crash in some cases
              involving triangulations with boundary.
        Class NTrivialTri:
            - Added recognition of one-tetrahedron balls.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Include several example triangulations in the triangulation
          creation dialog.
        - Allow exporting a triangulation to C++ source.
        - Renamed "Ideal to Finite" as "Truncate Ideal Vertices" in the menu.
        - Include a padlock in the corner of a packet icon if the packet
          is uneditable.
        - Tighter thread safety in the GUI.  This is required because some
          calculations (such as surface enumeration) run in a separate thread.
        - Worked around a Qt bug that caused a crash when pressing a key in
          a table of normal surfaces or matching equations.
        - Fixed a bug in which GAP output was unparseable due to GAP
          inserting spaces where Regina was not expecting them.
    UTILITIES:
        tricensus-mpi:
            - New census manager for use on MPI-enabled clusters.

          involving invalid and non-standard triangulations.
        - Beginning of a series of tests for elementary moves.
    BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
        - Updated libtool to version 1.5a.  Hopefully this will make
          things better for Darwin/Fink.
        - Requires KDE >= 3.2, so that the XDG applications directory can
          be used for the desktop file.
        - Verifies in the configure script that shared libraries are
          enabled where necessary (i.e., in the KDE and Python interfaces).
        - Better magic in the configure script for finding the correct
          boost.python libraries.
        - Fixed a bug in the configure script whereby -g stripping was
          too agressive, resulting in a compile failure for the python
          interface under some environments.

Version 4.1.3  [ 25 July, 2004 ]

    OVERALL:
        - Included the closed hyperbolic census of Hodgson and Weeks.
        - Made explicit in the reference manual introduction where the
          example files can be found.
    PYTHON:
        - For most objects, == now works like C++ pointer equality
          instead of Python object equality.  That is, it tests whether
          the Python wrappers point to the same C++ object, not whether
          the Python wrappers are in fact the same wrapper.
        - Fixed scripting in the GUI, which was broken with python 2.3
          (indented blocks were treated as complete after just one line).
        - Added a sample python session illustrating progress reporting.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Added an "Open Example" menu item for easy access to the
          sample files.
        - Allow the choice of text editor component to be configured.
        - Several fixes to make Regina work properly with the vimpart,
          including work-arounds for bugs in the vimpart itself.
        - Fixed the massive resource drain while editing a script's
          variable table in a heavily populated data file.
        - Fixed crashes that occured when deleting packets while a
          drop-down packet chooser is in use elsewhere.
        - Tightened up the handling of read-only mode for internal
          components.  Also removed some loopholes that allowed editing
          of uneditable packets.
        - Improved handling of keyboard focus.
        - Changed "Python Reference" to point to the modules index
          instead of the title page.

Version 4.1.2  [ 14 June, 2004 ]
    OVERALL:
        - Updated configure scripts so that the python interface builds
          out of the box on a larger number of platforms (specifically Red Hat
          and Fedora Core are now supported).  Many thanks to Craig Macintyre
          for his patience and assistance with this.
        - More updates to the troubleshooting section; overhauled the
          README.txt and website to hopefully make everything clearer
          and the important information easier to find.
        - Added a suggested form for citing Regina.
        - Updated INSTALL.txt to reflect current --prefix guessing.
    ENGINE:
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Added simplifiedFundamentalGroup() to allow external bodies
              such as GAP to simplify group presentations.
    USER INTERFACE:
        - Allow users to simplify fundamental groups using GAP.
        - Added "Education" to the categories for the desktop file, since
          KDE seems adamant about having no separate maths/science menu.
          Anything is better than showing up in Lost & Found. :)
        - Fixed compile error when building against an STL-enabled Qt
          (thanks to Robert Myers for spotting this one).

          context-specific menus, i.e., a "Triangulation" menu appears
          when a triangulation is open, etc.
        - Added "Please Wait" dialogs during slow operations.
        - Thorough "What's This?" support and tooltips offered across the
          entire user interface.
        - New tip-of-the-day support.
        - More icons for triangulation actions.
        - Updated the .desktop file and mimetype tests to work correctly
          with KDE 3.2.

        - Regina now ships with pregenerated manpages to avoid the need
          for docbook-utils and its complicated dependencies.
        - The troubleshooting section of the reference manual now
          includes compile-time problems and discusses the test suite.
    USER INTERFACE:

              two-sidedness and connectedness.
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - Enumeration routine now takes an optional progress manager
              and can run in a separate thread.
        Class NProgress:
            - Removed isCancellable() since this is not really necessary;
              an operation may simply choose not to poll for cancellation
              requests.
            - Removed isChanged() and made the changed flag protected so
              subclasses can modify it directly.

    JAVA USER INTERFACE:
        Overall structure:
            - Reads Regina options from directory $REGINA_OPTIONS_LOCAL
              and reads runtime options from system properties (which

            - Better error handling.
        normal.mainui:
            - Renamed SystemPane to TopologyPane and moved generic file
              editing functionality into FilePane to allow for editing
              different file types.
            - Much all-round cleaning up.
        normal.mainui.LibraryPane:
            - New class; allows editing of Jython libraries.

            - Fixed the packet renaming bug in the visual tree display.
        normal.mainui.PacketTreeNode:
            - Replaced insertUnwrappedDescendants() with
              verifyDescendants() which actually does what it should; thus
              the refresh button now works properly.
            - Added findChildNodeIndex().
        normal.packetui.PacketUI:
            - Added subtreeWasDeleted().

Version 2.1.1a  [ 8 March, 2001 ]
    OVERALL:
        - Set up system for creating distributions.
        - Final tidying up for proper release.

Version 2.1.1
    OVERALL:
        - Added a CORBA interface to the engine.
        - Rearranged Makefiles and directory structure for CVS and
          SourceForge.
    ENGINE:
        Overall structure:
            - Split config.h into config.h and regina.h.
        Class Engine:
            - Formalised and slightly rearranged.
            - Added getVersion...() routines.
        Class NBoolSet:
            - Now passed as characters to and from external interfaces.
              Added getByteCode(), setByteCode() and fromByteCode() for
              this purpose.
        Class NNormalSurfaceList:
            - Added coordinate system FACE_ARCS; renumbered EDGE_WEIGHT.
        Class NPerm:
            - Now passed as characters to and from external interfaces.
        Class NTriangulation:
            - Added routine isStandard().
    JAVA USER INTERFACE:
        Overall structure:
            - Allows running as an applet as well as an application.
            - Class normal.Application now contains just global constants
              and a generic applet/application shell.  Class normal.Shell
              contains top-level Regina runtime routines and routines
              specific to the shell type (applet or application).
            - Made miscellaneous optimisations.
        normal.packetui.census.NCensusCreator:
            - Altered the boundary combo box strings to avoid
              misinterpretation.
        normal.packetui.surfaces.NSurfaceFilterEditor:
            - Fixed the bug in which changes in the filter were not
              always being immediately reflected in the surface list.

Version 2.1.0  [ 18 December, 2000 ]
