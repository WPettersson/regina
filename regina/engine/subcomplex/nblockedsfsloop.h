/**
 * Represents a blocked Seifert fibred space with two boundary tori that
 * are joined together.  This is a particular type of triangulation of a
 * graph manifold, formed from a single saturated region whose two torus
 * boundaries are identified.  An optional layering may be placed
 * between the two torus boundaries to allow for a more interesting
 * relationship between the two sets of boundary curves.  For more
 * detail on saturated regions and their constituent saturated blocks,
 * see the NSatRegion class; for more detail on layerings, see the
 * NLayering class.
 *
 * The saturated region may have two boundary components formed from one
 * saturated annulus each.  Alternatively, it may have one boundary
 * formed from two saturated annuli, where this boundary is pinched
 * together so that each annulus becomes a two-sided torus (both of which
 * are later joined together).  None of the boundary components (or the
 * two-sided tori discussed above) may be twisted (i.e., they must be
 * tori, not Klein bottles).
 *
 * The way in which the two torus boundaries are identified is specified
 * by a 2-by-2 matrix, which expresses curves representing the fibres
 * and base orbifold on the second boundary in terms of such curves on
 * the first boundary (see the page on \ref sfsnotation for terminology).
 *
 * More specifically, suppose that \a f0 and \a o0 are directed curves
 * on the first boundary torus and \a f1 and \a o1 are directed curves
 * on the second boundary torus, where \a f0 and \a f1 represent the
 * fibres of the region and \a o0 and \a o1 represent the base orbifold.
 * Then the boundaries are joined according to the following relation:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     [f1]       [f0]
 *     [  ] = M * [  ]
 *     [o1]       [o0]
 * </pre>
 *
 * If a layering is present between the two torus boundaries, then the
 * corresponding boundary curves are not identified directly.  In this
 * case, the matrix \a M shows how the layering relates the curves on
 * each boundary.
 *
 * Note that the routines writeName() and writeTeXName() do \e not
 * offer enough information to uniquely identify the triangulation,
 * since this essentially requires 2-dimensional assemblings of
 * saturated blocks.  For full details, writeTextLong() may be used instead.
 *
 * The optional NStandardTriangulation routine getManifold() is
 * implemented for this class, but getHomologyH1() is not.
