/**
 * Describes a triangulation of a graph manifold formed by joining a
 * bounded saturated region with a thin I-bundle over the torus,
 * possibly with layerings in between.
 *
 * The thin I-bundle must be untwisted, so that it forms the product
 * <tt>T x I</tt> with two boundary tori.  Moreover, it must be isomorphic
 * to some existing instance of the class NTxICore.
 *
 * The saturated region is described by an object of the class NSatRegion.
 * This region must have precisely two boundary annuli.  These may be
 * two separate torus boundaries (each formed from its own saturated annulus).
 * Alternatively, the saturated region may have a single boundary formed
 * from both saturated annuli, where this boundary is pinched together
 * so that each annulus becomes its own two-sided torus.
 *
 * Either way, the saturated region effectively has two torus boundaries,
 * each formed from two faces of the triangulation.  These boundaries
 * are then joined to the two torus boundaries of the thin I-bundle,
 * possibly with layerings in between (for more detail on layerings, see
 * the NLayering class).  This is illustrated in the following diagram,
 * where the small tunnels show where the torus boundaries are joined
 * (possibly via layerings).
 *
 * <pre>
 *    /--------------------\     /-----------------\
 *    |                     -----                  |
 *    |                     -----                  |
 *    |  Saturated region  |     |  Thin I-bundle  |
 *    |                     -----                  |
 *    |                     -----                  |
 *    \--------------------/     \-----------------/
 * </pre>
 *
 * The effect of the thin I-bundle and the two layerings is essentially
 * to join the two boundaries of the saturated region according to some
 * non-trivial homeomorphism of the torus.  This homeomorphism is
 * specified by a 2-by-2 matrix \a M as follows.
 *
 * Suppose that \a f0 and \a o0 are directed curves on the first
 * boundary torus and \a f1 and \a o1 are directed curves on the second
 * boundary torus, where \a f0 and \a f1 represent the fibres of the
 * saturated region and \a o0 and \a o1 represent the base orbifold (see
 * the page on \ref sfsnotation for terminology).
 * Then the torus boundaries of the saturated region are identified by
 * the thin I-bundle and layerings according to the following relation:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     [f1]       [f0]
 *     [  ] = M * [  ]
 *     [o1]       [o0]
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that the routines writeName() and writeTeXName() do \e not offer
 * enough information to uniquely identify the triangulation, since this
 * essentially requires 2-dimensional assemblings of saturated blocks.
 * For more detail, writeTextLong() may be used instead.
 *
 * The optional NStandardTriangulation routine getManifold() is
 * implemented for this class, but getHomologyH1() is not.
