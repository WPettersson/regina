/**
 * Represents a 3-manifold triangulation from the SnapPea cusped census.
 *
 * The SnapPea cusped census is the census of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds
 * formed from up to seven tetrahedra.  This census was tabulated by
 * Callahan, Hildebrand and Weeks, and is shipped with SnapPea 3.0d3
 * (and also with Regina).
 *
 * The census is split into five different sections according to number
 * of tetrahedra and orientability.  Each of these sections corresponds
 * to one of the section constants defined in this class.
 *
 * For further details regarding the SnapPea census, see "A census of cusped
 * hyperbolic 3-manifolds", Patrick J. Callahan, Martin V. Hildebrand and
 * Jeffrey R. Weeks, Math. Comp. 68 (1999), no. 225, pp. 321--332.
 *
 * Note that this class is closely tied to NSnapPeaCensusManifold.
 * In particular, the section constants defined in NSnapPeaCensusManifold
 * and NSnapPeaCensusTri are identical, and so may be freely mixed.
 * Furthermore, the section and index parameters of an NSnapPeaCensusTri
 * are identical to those of its corresponding NSnapPeaCensusManifold.
 *
 * All of the optional NStandardTriangulation routines are implemented
 * for this class.
