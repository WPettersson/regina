/**
 * Represents an augmented triangular solid torus component of a
 * triangulation.  Such a component is obtained as follows.  Begin with
 * a three-tetrahedron triangular solid torus (as described by
 * NTriSolidTorus).  Observe that the three axis edges divide the
 * boundary into three annuli.  Then take one of the following actions.
 *
 *   - To each of these annuli, glue a layered solid torus.
 *     Note that the degenerate (2,1,1) layered solid torus
 *     (i.e., a one-triangle mobius strip) is allowed and corresponds to
 *     simply gluing the two faces of the annulus together.
 *
 *   - To one of these annuli, glue a layered solid torus as described
 *     above.  Join the other two annuli with a layered chain
 *     in either the manner described by
 *     NTriSolidTorus::areAnnuliLinkedMajor() or the manner described by
 *     NTriSolidTorus::areAnnuliLinkedAxis().
 *
 * It will be assumed that all layered solid tori other than the
 * degenerate (2,1,1) will have (3,2,1) layered solid tori at their
 * bases.  That is, layered solid tori that begin with the degenerate
 * (2,1,1) and layer over the boundary of the mobius strip are \b not
 * considered in this class.
 *
 * Note that (unless a (1,1,0) layered solid torus is used with the 0
 * edge glued to an axis edge) the resulting space will be a Seifert
 * fibred space over the 2-sphere with at most three exceptional fibres.
 *
 * Of the optional NStandardTriangulation routines, getManifold() is
 * implemented for most augmented triangular solid tori and
 * getHomologyH1() is not implemented at all.
