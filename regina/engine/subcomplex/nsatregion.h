/**
 * Describes how a single saturated block forms a part of a larger
 * saturated region.
 *
 * A saturated region consists of several saturated blocks joined
 * together along their boundary annuli.  This is a helper structure
 * containing a single saturated block along with details of its
 * orientation within a larger region.
 *
 * The ring of saturated annuli around the boundary of the block gives a
 * natural orientation to the block within the context of the base orbifold,
 * just as the ring of edges around a polygon would give a natural
 * orientation to that polygon within the context of a surrounding surface.
 * Again drawing an analogy with the orientation of polygons within a surface,
 * each block can be considered to have a correct or reflected orientation
 * according to whether this ring of annuli runs clockwise or anticlockwise
 * in the base orbifold.
 *
 * The precise orientation of a block is described using two booleans.
 * A block may be reflected \e horizontally, which preserves the
 * directions of Seifert fibres but which reverses the
 * clockwise/anticlockwise orientation as discussed above.  A block may
 * also be reflected \e vertically, which preserves the
 * clockwise/anticlockwise orientation but which reverses the directions
 * of the Seifert fibres.  A block may of course be reflected both
 * horizontally and vertically, or it may not be reflected at all.
 *
 * This helper structure is small, and can be copied by value if
 * necessary.  Be aware that when this structure is destroyed, the
 * internal block structure of type NSatBlock is \e not destroyed.
 *
 * \ifacespython The data members \a block, \a refVert and \a refHoriz
 * are read-only.

/**
 * A large saturated region in a Seifert fibred space formed by joining
 * together saturated blocks.
 *
 * Like a saturated block (described in the class NSatBlock), a
 * saturated region is a connected set of tetrahedra built from a subset
 * of fibres.  Unlike a saturated block however, a saturated region has
 * no constraints on its boundary - it may have several boundary
 * components or it may have none.  For instance, a saturated region
 * might be an entire closed Seifert fibred space, or it might describe
 * a Seifert fibred component of a JSJ decomposition.
 *
 * A saturated region is formed from a collection of saturated blocks by
 * joining the boundary annuli of these blocks together in pairs.  The
 * joins must be made so that the fibres are consistent, though it is
 * allowable to reverse the directions of the fibres.  There is no problem
 * with joining two boundary annuli from the same block to each other.
 *
 * Any boundary annulus of a block that is not joined to some other
 * boundary annulus of a block becomes a boundary annulus of the entire
 * region.  In this way, each boundary component of the region (if there
 * are any at all) is formed from a ring of boundary annuli, in the same
 * way that the boundary of a block is.  Note that the routine
 * NSatBlock::nextBoundaryAnnulus() can be used to trace around a region
 * boundary.  Like block boundaries, the boundary of a saturated region
 * need not be part of the boundary of the larger triangulation (i.e.,
 * there may be adjacent tetrahedra that are not recognised as part of
 * this saturated structure).
 *
 * The NSatRegion class stores a list of its constituent blocks, but it
 * does not directly store which block boundary annuli are joined to
 * which.  This adjacency information is stored within the blocks
 * themselves; see the notes regarding adjacency in the NSatBlock class
 * description.
 *
 * Blocks cannot be added to a region by hand.  The way a region is
 * constructed is by locating some initial block within a triangulation
 * and passing this to the NSatRegion constructor, and then by calling
 * expand() to locate adjacent blocks and expand the region as far as
 * possible.  For locating initial blocks, the class
 * NSatBlockStarterSearcher may be of use.
 *
 * \warning It is crucial that the adjacency information stored in the
 * blocks is consistent with the region containing them.  All this
 * requires is that the blocks are not manipulated externally (e.g.,
 * NSatBlock::setAdjacent() is not called on any of the blocks), but
 * instead all adjacency information is managed by this class.  Routines
 * such as expand() which may add more blocks to the region will update
 * the block adjacencies accordingly.
 *
 * \todo \feature Have this class track the boundary components properly,
 * with annuli grouped and oriented according to the region boundaries (as
 * opposed to individual block boundaries).

         * Expands this region as far as possible within the overall
         * triangulation.  This routine will hunt for new saturated
         * blocks, and will also hunt for new adjacencies between
         * existing blocks.
         *
         * The first argument to this routine is the tetrahedron list
         * \a avoidTets.  This is a list of tetrahedra that will not be
         * considered when examining potential new blocks.  This list
         * will be modified by this routine; in particular, it will be
         * expanded to include all tetrahedra for any new blocks that
         * are found.  Before calling this routine it should contain
         * tetrahedra for blocks already in this region, as discussed in
         * the preconditions below.
         *
         * It may be that you are searching for a region that fills an entire
         * triangulation component (i.e., every boundary annulus of the
         * region in fact forms part of the boundary of the triangulation).
         * In this case you may pass the optional argument
         * \a stopIfIncomplete as \c true.  This means that if this routine
         * ever discovers an annulus that is not part of the
         * triangulation boundary and that it cannot match with some
         * adjacent block, it will exit immediately and return \c false.
         * Note that the region structure will be incomplete and/or
         * inconsistent if this happens; in this case the unfinished
         * region should be destroyed completely and never used.
         *
         * For internal purposes, it should be noted that any new blocks
         * that are discovered will be added to the end of the internal
         * block list (thus the indices of existing blocks will not change).
         *
         * \warning When joining blocks together, it is possible to
         * create invalid edges (e.g., by joining a one-annulus
         * untwisted boundary to a one-annulus twisted boundary).
         * This routine does \e not check for such conditions.  It is
         * recommended that you run NTriangulation::isValid() before
         * calling this routine.
         *
         * \pre If any blocks already belonging to this region have
         * adjacencies listed in their NSatBlock structures, then these
         * adjacent blocks belong to this region also.  This precondition
         * is easily satisfied if you let the NSatRegion constructor
         * and expand() do all of the adjacency handling, as described
         * in the class notes.
         * \pre The list \a avoidTets includes all tetrahedra on the
         * boundaries of any blocks already contained in this region.
         *
         * \ifacespython The first argument \a avoidTets is not present.
         * An empty list will be passed instead.
         *
         * @param avoidTets a list of tetrahedra that should not be
         * considered for new blocks, as discussed above.  Note that
         * this list may be modified by this routine.
         * @param stopIfIncomplete \c true if you are filling an entire
         * triangulation component with this region and you wish this
         * routine to exit early if this is not possible, or \c false
         * (the default) if you simply wish to expand this region as far
         * as you can.  See above for further discussion.
         * @return \c false if the optional argument \a stopIfIncomplete
         * was passed as \c true but expansion did not fill the entire
         * triangulation component as described above, or \c true in all
