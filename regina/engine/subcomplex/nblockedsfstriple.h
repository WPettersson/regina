/**
 * Represents a blocked sequence of three Seifert fibred spaces joined
 * along connecting tori.  This is a particular type of triangulation
 * of a graph manifold, formed from three saturated regions whose
 * various torus boundaries are identified as described below.
 * Optional layerings may be placed between torus boundaries to
 * allow for more interesting relationships between the
 * respective boundary curves of each region.  For more detail on
 * saturated regions and their constituent saturated blocks, see the
 * NSatRegion class; for more detail on layerings, see the NLayering class.
 *
 * The three saturated regions must be joined together as illustrated
 * below.  Each large box represents a saturated region, and the small
 * tunnels show where the region boundaries are joined (possibly via
 * layerings).
 *
 * <pre>
 *     /----------------\   /------------------\   /----------------\
 *     |                |   |                  |   |                |
 *     |  End region 0   ---   Central region   ---   End region 1  |
 *     |                 ---                    ---                 |
 *     |                |   |                  |   |                |
 *     \----------------/   \------------------/   \----------------/
 * </pre>
 *
 * Each of the end regions must have precisely one boundary component
 * formed from just one saturated annulus.  The central region may have
 * two boundary components formed from one saturated annulus each.
 * Alternatively, it may have one boundary formed from two saturated
 * annuli, where this boundary is pinched together so that each annulus
 * becomes a two-sided torus joined to one of the end regions.  None of
 * the boundary components (or the two-sided tori discussed above) may
 * be twisted (i.e., they must be tori, not Klein bottles).
 *
 * The ways in which the various region boundaries are identified are
 * specified by 2-by-2 matrices, which express curves representing the
 * fibres and base orbifold of each end region in terms of the central
 * region (see the page on \ref sfsnotation for terminology).
 *
 * Specifically, consider the matrix \a M that describes the joining of
 * the central region and the first end region (marked in the diagram
 * above as end region 0).  Suppose that \a f and \a o are directed
 * curves on the central region boundary and \a f0 and \a o0 are directed
 * curves on the first end region boundary, where \a f and \a f0 represent
 * the fibres of each region and \a o and \a o0 represent the base orbifolds.
 * Then the boundaries are joined according to the following relation:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     [f0]       [f ]
 *     [  ] = M * [  ]
 *     [o0]       [o ]
 * </pre>
 *
 * Likewise, let \a M' be the matrix describing how the central region
 * and the second end region (marked in the diagram as end region 1) are
 * joined.  Let \a f' and \a o' be directed curves on the other central
 * region boundary and \a f1 and \a o1 be directed curves on the second
 * end region boundary, where \a f' and \a f1 represent fibres and
 * \a o and \a o1 represent the base orbifolds.  Then the boundaries are
 * joined according to the relation:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     [f1]        [f']
 *     [  ] = M' * [  ]
 *     [o1]        [o']
 * </pre>
 *
 * If a layering is present between two regions, then the corresponding
 * boundary curves are not identified directly.  In this case, the relevant
 * matrix \a M or \a M' shows how the layering relates the curves on each
 * region boundary.
 *
 * Note that the routines writeName() and writeTeXName() do \e not
 * offer enough information to uniquely identify the triangulation,
 * since this essentially requires 2-dimensional assemblings of
 * saturated blocks.  For full details, writeTextLong() may be used instead.
 *
 * The optional NStandardTriangulation routine getManifold() is
 * implemented for this class, but getHomologyH1() is not.
