/**
 * Represents a 2-sphere made from two snapped 3-balls in a triangulation.
 * This occurs when two snapped 3-balls are glued together at their
 * equators (note that this gluing does not have to extend to faces).  Each
 * 3-ball has a central disc (bounded by the 3-ball's equator and bisecting
 * its internal edge), and these two discs together form an embedded
 * 2-sphere in the triangulation.
 *
 * This 2-sphere can be cut along and the two resulting 2-sphere
 * boundaries filled in with 3-balls, and the resulting triangulation has
 * the same number of tetrahedra as the original.  If the snapped
 * 2-sphere was separating, the resulting triangulation will contain the
 * two terms of the corresponding connected sum.
