/**
 * Provides a triangulation of the product <tt>T x I</tt> (the
 * product of the torus and the interval).  Generally these
 * triangulations are only one tetrahedron thick (i.e., a "thin I-bundle"),
 * though this is not a strict requirement of this class.  Triangulations of
 * this type are generally used as components of larger triangulations
 * (such as layered surface bundles).
 *
 * This product has two torus boundaries, called the \a upper and
 * \a lower boundaries.  Each of these boundary tori must be formed from
 * precisely two faces.  This class tracks the mappings between parallel
 * curves on the upper and lower boundaries, as well as mappings from
 * boundary curves to specific tetrahedron edges.
 *
 * For each of the two torus boundaries, two curves are chosen as
 * generators of the fundamental group; these curves are called
 * \a alpha and \a beta.  Note that there is no requirement that the
 * upper \a alpha and \a beta be parallel to the lower \a alpha and
 * \a beta.  The parallelReln() routine can be called to establish the
 * precise relationship between these upper and lower curves.
 *
 * Every object of this class contains a full copy of the triangulation
 * that it describes (so you should not create excessive objects of this
 * class without reason).  This triangulation can be accessed through the
 * core() routine.

/**
 * One of a family of thin <tt>T x I</tt> triangulations that typically
 * appear at the centres of layered torus bundles.  Different
 * triangulations in this family use different numbers of tetrahedra,
 * with the larger triangulations producing more complicated
 * relationships between the upper and lower boundary curves.
 *
 * Members of this family are parameterised by their size (the number of
 * tetrahedra) and an additional integer \a k, where
 * 1 <= \a k <= \a size - 5.  Note that this means we must have
 * \a size >= 6.  The member of this family of size \a n with additional
 * parameter \a k is labelled <tt>T_n:k</tt>.
 *
 * It is worth noting that <tt>T_n:k</tt> is isomorphic to
 * <tt>T_n:(n-4-k)</tt>, so in reality there are only [(\a n-4)/2]
 * different triangulations for a given size (rounded down).
 *
 * A triangulation of this family is most easily defined in terms of its
 * central torus.  Central surfaces are described in detail in
 * "Structures of small closed non-orientable 3-manifold triangulations",
 * Benjamin A. Burton, J. Knot Theory Ramifications 16 (2007), 545--574;
 * in particular, see the section on thin I-bundles.
 *
 * The central torus begins with two triangles \a u0 and \a u1 (which
 * eventually provide the upper torus boundary), with a chain of
 * quadrilaterals \a q1, ..., \a q(\a n-5) descending diagonally beneath
 * them as illustrated in the diagram below.
 *
 * \image html diaginit.png
 *
 * We then distort quadrilateral \a qk and attach two more triangles
 * \a w0 and \a w1 to its side (these will eventually provide the lower
 * torus boundary).  This is illustrated in the following diagram.
 *
 * \image html diagdistort.png
 *
 * The entire central torus wraps from left to right (so the lower left
 * edges of most quadrilaterals \a qi are identified with the upper right
 * edges of \a q(\a i-1), and the left edge of \a qk is identified with
 * the right edge of \a w1).  As an exception, the two uppermost edges are
 * identified with the two lowermost edges in a parallel fashion (so the
 * upper left edge of \a u1 is identified with the lower right edge of \a q1,
 * and the adjacent edges at right angles to these are also identified).
 *
 * The four triangles in the central torus correspond to the four tetrahedra
 * in the triangulation that provide the boundary faces.  The upper boundary
 * is coned out from triangles \a u0 and \a u1, and the lower boundary is
 * coned out from triangles \a w0 and \a w1.  In each boundary, \a u0 or
 * \a w0 gives the first boundary face and \a u1 or \a w1 gives the second.
 * The directions of the corresponding \a alpha and \a beta curves are
 * illustrated below.
 *
 * \image html diagbdry.png
 *
 * As a final illustration, the example below shows the central surface in
 * the case (\a n, \a k) = (9, 2).
