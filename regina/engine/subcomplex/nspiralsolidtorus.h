/**
 * Represents a spiralled solid torus in a triangulation.
 *
 * A spiralled solid torus is created by placing tetrahedra one upon
 * another in a spiralling fashion to form a giant loop.
 *
 * For each tetrahedron, label the vertices A, B, C and D.  Draw the
 * tetrahedron so that the vertices form an upward spiral in the order
 * A-B-C-D, with D directly above A.  Face BCD is on the top, face ABC
 * is on the bottom and faces ABD and ACD are both vertical.
 *
 * When joining two tetrahedra, face BCD of the lower tetrahedron will
 * be joined to face ABC of the upper tetrahedron.  In this way the
 * tetrahedra are placed one upon another to form a giant loop (which is
 * closed up by placing the bottommost tetrahedron above the topmost
 * tetrahedron in a similar fashion), forming a solid torus overall.
 *
 * In each tetrahedron, directed edges AB, BC and CD are <i>major edges</i>,
 * directed edges AC and BD are <i>minor edges</i> and directed edge AD
 * is an <i>axis edge</i>.
 *
 * The major edges all combined form a single longitude of the solid
 * torus.  Using this directed longitude, using the directed meridinal curve
 * ACBA and assuming the spiralled solid torus contains \a n tetrahedra,
 * the minor edges all combined form a (2, <i>n</i>) curve and
 * the axis edges all combined form a (3, <i>n</i>) curve on the torus
 * boundary.
 *
 * Note that all tetrahedra in the spiralled solid torus must be distinct
 * and there must be at least one tetrahedron.
 *
 * Note also that class NTriSolidTorus represents a spiralled solid
 * torus with precisely three tetrahedra.  A spiralled solid torus with
 * only one tetrahedron is in fact a (1,2,3) layered solid torus.
 *
 * All optional NStandardTriangulation routines are implemented for this
 * class.
