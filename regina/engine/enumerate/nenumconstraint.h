/**
 * Represents an individual validity constraint for use with
 * polytope vertex enumeration.
 *
 * Vertex enumeration routines such as
 * NDoubleDescription::enumerateExtremalRays() take a cone (specifically
 * the non-negative orthant), form the intersection of that cone with a
 * given linear subspace, and return the extremal rays of the new cone
 * that results.
 *
 * In some cases we are only interested in \e valid rays of the new cone.
 * The NEnumConstraintList class stores a number of "validity constraints";
 * a ray is then "valid" if it satisfies all of these constraints.
 *
 * Each individual constraint is presented as a set of integers; the
 * meaning of such a constraint is as follows.  We number the facets of
 * the original cone 0,1,2,... (where the <i>i</i>th facet is the plane
 * perpendicular to the <i>i</i>th coordinate axis).  If a constraint is
 * described by the integers \a x, \a y, \a z, ..., then it indicates that a
 * ray can only lie outside at most one of the facets numbered
 * \a x, \a y, \a z, ... .
 *
 * In practice, this allows us to represent constraints in normal
 * surface theory.  For instance, to insist that some tetrahedron
 * contains at most one quadrilateral disc type, we add a constraint
 * with three integers, representing the original facets
 * \a q1=0, \a q2=0, \a q3=0 (where \a q1, \a q2 and \a q3 are the three
 * quadrilateral coordinates for that tetrahedron).
 *
 * The NEnumConstraintList class is simply a std::vector of constraints,
 * where each constraint is a std::set of unsigned integers.  Typically
 * one will create a vector containing the desired number of constraints
 * and then walk through each constraint, filling the sets as appropriate.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present.
