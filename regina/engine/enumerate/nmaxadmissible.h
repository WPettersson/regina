        /**
         * Enumerates all maximal admissible faces of the given polyhedral cone.
         * The cone must be the intersection of the non-negative orthant in some
         * Euclidean space R^n with a linear subspace.
         *
         * Admissibility is defined by the given set of constraints.  Each
         * constraint requires that at most one of a given set of coordinates
         * can be non-zero; see the NEnumConstraintList class for details.
         * In particular, the quadrilateral constraints from normal surface
         * theory are of this type.
         *
         * It is simple to show that the admissible region of the cone is a
         * union of faces, which we call "admissible faces".  Those admissible
         * faces that do not appear as a strict subface of some other
         * admissible face are called "maximal admissible faces".
         * The admissible region can therefore be expressed as the union of
         * all maximal admissible faces.
         *
         * The input for this routine is the set of all admissible extremal rays
         * of the cone.  These should be computed beforehand; for instance,
         * using the routine NDoubleDescription::enumerateExtremalRays().
         *
         * The return value is the set of all maximal admissible faces, stored
         * in a newly allocated vector.  Each face \a F is described by a
         * bitmask.  Specifically: if we are working in R^n, then each face is
         * described by a bitmask \a b of length n, where <tt>b[i]</tt>
         * is \c false if every point \a x in \a F has <tt>x[i]=0</tt>,
         * and <tt>b[i]</tt> is \c true if every point \a x in the relative
         * interior of \a F has <tt>x[i] &gt; 0</tt>.
         *
         * \pre The template argument RayIterator should be an iterator
         * type that, when dereferenced, can be cast to a const NRay*.
         *
         * \pre The template argument BitmaskType is one of the bitmask
         * types NBitmask, NBitmask1 or NBitmask2.
         *
         * \pre Bitmasks of type BitmaskType can hold \a n bits, where
         * \a n is the dimension of the underlying space (i.e., the size
         * of the input vectors described by \a beginExtremalRays and
         * \a endExtremalRays).  This is always true of NBitmask, but
         * you must be careful when using one of the fast but size-limited
         * types NBitmask1 or NBitmask2.
         *
         * @param beginExtremalRays an iterator that begins the set of
         * admissible extremal rays, as described above.  Typically this would
         * be rays.begin() if \a rays is a standard container type.
         * @param endExtremalRays an iterator that is past-the-end of the set
         * of admissible extremal rays.  Typically this would be rays.end()
         * if \a rays is a standard container type.
         * @param constraints a set of validity constraints as described
         * above.  This may be 0 to indicate no constraints (in which
         * case there will be just one maximal admissible face).
         * @return a newly allocated list containing one bitmask
         * representing each maximal admissible face, as described above.
