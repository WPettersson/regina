 * The main class Dim2GluingPermSearcher offers a default search
 * algorithm that may be used in a general context.
 *
 * The simplest way of performing a search through all possible gluing
 * permutations is by calling the static method findAllPerms().  This will
 * examine the search parameters and ensure that the best possible algorithm
 * is used.  For finer control over the program flow, the static method
 * bestSearcher() can be used to create a search manager of the most
 * suitable class and then runSearch() can be called on this object directly.
 * For absolute control, a specific algorithm can be forced by explicitly
 * constructing an object of the corresponding class (and again
 * calling runSearch() on that object directly).
 *
 * Note that this class derives from Dim2GluingPerms.  The search will
 * involve building and repeatedly modifying the inherited Dim2GluingPerms
 * data in-place.
