/**
 * Specifies whether the NClosedPrimeMinSearcher census generation code
 * should prune on high-degree edges.
 *
 * It is well known that a closed prime minimal P^2-irreducible triangulation
 * formed from at least three tetrahedra can never have an edge of degree
 * one or two.  Combining this with the fact that such a triangulation
 * must always have one vertex, a simple Euler characteristic
 * calculation shows that there must be precisely n+1 edges, where \a n
 * is the number of tetrahedra.
 *
 * A little arithmetic then shows that, for any \a k edges, the sum of
 * their edge degrees can be no more than 3(n+k-1); otherwise one of the
 * remaining edges will be forced to have degree one or two.  This
 * observation is the basis behind the high-degree edge pruning that
 * this option controls.
 *
 * To enable pruning on high-degree edges, set this macro to 1 (the default
 * for Regina's main source distribution); to disable it, set it to 0.
