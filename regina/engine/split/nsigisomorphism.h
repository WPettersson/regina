 * Represents a partial isomorphism between two splitting surface
 * signatures.  See class NSignature for details on splitting surface
 * signatures.
 *
 * The two signatures related by this partial isomorphism must have the
 * same cycle structure, i.e., the same number of cycle groups and the
 * same cycle length and number of cycles within each cycle group.
 *
 * The partial isomorphism maps symbols to symbols and cycles to cycles,
 * with the option of rotating some cycles and/or reversing all cycles in
 * the process.
 * Cycles within the <i>k</i>th cycle group of the source signature
 * must map to cycles within the <i>k</i>th cycle group of the
 * destination signature.
 *
 * A \e partial isomorphism is only required to map the cycles
 * and symbols found in the first <i>g</i> cycle groups of the
 * source isomorphism (for some <i>g</i>).  If only a subset of symbols
 * are mapped, that subset must be symbols 0,1,...,<i>k</i> for some <i>k</i>.
