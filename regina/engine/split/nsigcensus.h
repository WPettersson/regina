 * Forms a census of all splitting surface signatures of the given order.

 * Each signature will be produced precisely once up to equivalence.
 * Signatures are considered equivalent if they are related by some
 * combination of:
 * - relabelling symbols;
 * - rotating an individual cycle;
 * - inverting an individual cycle (i.e., reversing the cycle and
 *   changing the case of each symbol in the cycle);
 * - reversing all cycles without changing the case of any symbols.
 *
 * Each signature produced will have its cycles ordered by decreasing
 * length.  Each cycle will have at least half of its symbols lower-case.
 *
 * For each signature that is generated, routine \a use (as passed to this
 * function) will be called with that signature and its automorphisms as
 * arguments.
 *
 * \warning Currently upper-case symbols in signatures are not supported
 * by this routine; only signatures whose symbols are all lower-case will
 * be produced.
 *
 * \todo \feature Add support for symbols of differing case.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present.
 *
 * @param order the order of signatures to generate.
 * @param use the function to call upon each signature that is found.
 * The first parameter passed to this function will be a splitting
 * surface signature.  The second parameter will be a list of all its
 * automorphisms.  The third parameter will be parameter \a useArgs as
 * was passed to this routine.
 * @param useArgs the pointer to pass as the final parameter for the
 * function \a use which will be called upon each signature found.
 * @return the total number of non-equivalent signatures that were found.
