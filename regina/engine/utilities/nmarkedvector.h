/**
 * A base class for elements of NMarkedVector.
 *
 * NMarkedVector is a vector class that provides fast, space-efficient
 * reverse lookup of array indices (i.e., given an object, find the
 * index at which it is stored).  The way it does this is to store the
 * array indices in the object themselves.
 *
 * As a result, any type to be stored in an NMarkedVector must be derived
 * from this class.  This class provides a space to store the
 * corresponding array index, and looks after access control so that
 * only NMarkedVector can edit this index.
 *
 * Since indices are stored with the objects, it is possible to perform
 * this reverse lookup by querying the object alone, without any
 * reference to the actual vector.  This can be done through the public
 * routine markedIndex().
 *
 * The trade-off of course is that any object may not belong to more
 * than one NMarkedVector at a time.  Any attempt to do this will result
 * in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * See NMarkedVector for further information.

/**
 * A vector of objects with fast, space-efficient reverse lookup of
 * array indices.
 *
 * This class derives from std::vector, and so provides fast forward
 * lookups from array indices to objects.  What NMarkedVector provides
 * in addition to this is fast reverse lookups from objects back to
 * array indices.
 *
 * The way this class is able to provide fast constant-time reverse
 * lookups without consuming a great deal of space (unlike NIndexedArray
 * and its space-hungry hash tables) is by storing array indices
 * inside the objects themselves.  As a result, there are two
 * significant constraints:
 *
 * - This class can only store objects derived from NMarkedElement
 *   (which provides space for storing the array indices and handles
 *   their access control).  In particular, it cannot store native types
 *   such as \c int or predefined types such as \c std::string.
 *
 * - An object can only belong to one NMarkedVector at a time.  Any
 *   attempt to insert an object into more than one NMarkedVector at the
 *   same time results in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * Using this class is fairly simple.  The class provides a restricted
 * subset of the std::vector functionality, including \a iterator,
 * \a const_iterator, \a begin, \a end, \a size, \a empty, \a front,
 * \a back, operator [], and \a clear (this subset may grow over
 * time if required).  In addition, any const method of std::vector can
 * be accessed through an explicit cast to const std::vector&.  To
 * perform a reverse lookup (find the index at which an array is stored),
 * simply call the object's inherited method NMarkedElement::markedIndex().
 *
 * Note that, like its parent std::vector, this class performs no memory
 * management.  In particular, elements (which are pointers to real objects)
 * are not destroyed when they are removed from a vector or when the vector
 * is eventually destroyed.
 *
 * \pre The type \a T is a class derived from NMarkedElement.
