/**
 * A trie-like data structure for storing and retriving sets.
 * This class is useful when the \e elements of these sets are taken from a
 * fairly small universe, but where the \e number of sets being stored
 * can be extremely large.
 *
 * For simplicity, let the universe consist of the integers 0,...,\a n.
 * Sets are represented as bitmasks of type \a T (which must be capable
 * of holding bitmasks of length \a n).  The <i>i</i>th bit of a bitmask
 * indicates whether the integer \a i belongs to the corresponding set.
 *
 * To construct an empty trie, simply call the default constructor.
 * To insert a new set into the trie, call insert() (whose running time is
 * linear in \a n).  You can insert the same set into the trie multiple times
 * and the trie will record the number of times that it occurs.
 *
 * Currently the only searching operations are hasSubset() and
 * hasExtraSuperset().  These operations are slow, but still
 * much faster than searching through a linear list; see the
 * hasSubset() and hasExtraSuperset() documentation for details.
 *
 * The implementation of this data structure uses a binary tree with
 * depth levels 0,...,\a n, where each node at level \a i represents a
 * potential length-\a i prefix for a bitmask.  So, for instance,
 * the root node represents the empty prefix, its children represent
 * prefixes 0 and 1, their children represent prefixes 00, 01, 10 and 11,
 * and so on.
 *
 * Internally, a set is "stored" at the first node whose prefix
 * in fact describes the entire set.  For instance, the bitmask
 * 101100 is stored at the node corresponding to the prefix 1011,
 * which occurs at level 3 of the tree.  Regions of the tree that do
 * not store any sets are never explicitly constructed in memory.
 *
 * \pre The template argument T is one of Regina's bitmask types, such
 * as NBitmask, NBitmask1 or NBitmask2.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present.
