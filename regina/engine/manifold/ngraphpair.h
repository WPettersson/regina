/**
 * Represents a closed graph manifold formed by joining
 * two bounded Seifert fibred spaces along a common torus.
 *
 * Each Seifert fibred space must have just one boundary component,
 * corresponding to a puncture in the base orbifold (with no
 * fibre-reversing twist as one travels around this boundary).
 *
 * The way in which the two spaces are joined is specified by a 2-by-2
 * matrix \a M.  This matrix expresses the locations of the fibres and
 * base orbifold of the second Seifert fibred space in terms of the first.
 *
 * More specifically, suppose that \a f0 and \a o0 are generators of the
 * common torus, where \a f0 represents a directed fibre in the first
 * Seifert fibred space and \a o0 represents the oriented boundary of
 * the corresponding base orbifold.  Likewise, let \a f1 and \a o1 be
 * generators of the common torus representing a directed fibre and
 * the base orbifold of the second Seifert fibred space.  Then the curves
 * \a f0, \a o0, \a f1 and \a o1 are related as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     [f1]       [f0]
 *     [  ] = M * [  ]
 *     [o1]       [o0]
 * </pre>
 *
 * See the page on \ref sfsnotation for details on some of the
 * terminology used above.
 *
 * The optional NManifold routine getHomologyH1() is implemented, but
 * the optional routine construct() is not.
 *
 * \testpart
 *
 * \todo \opt Speed up homology calculations involving orientable base
 * spaces by adding rank afterwards, instead of adding generators for
 * genus into the presentation matrix.
