/**
 * Reads a list of isomorphism signatures from the given text file.
 * The file should contain one isomorphism signature per line.
 * These isomorphism signatures will be converted into triangulations using
 * NTriangulation::fromIsoSig().
 *
 * A newly allocated container will be returned; the imported
 * triangulations will be inserted as children of this container.
 * The container will not be assigned a label.  The individual
 * triangulations will be assigned labels according to the parameter
 * \a colLabels.
 *
 * If any isomorphism signatures are invalid, these will be recorded in an
 * additional text packet that will be the last child of the returned
 * container.
 *
 * If an I/O error occurred while trying to read the given file, 0 will be
 * returned.
 *
 * In its simplest form, the text file can simply contain one
 * isomorphism signature per line and nothing else.  However, more complex
 * formats are allowed.  In particular, by passing appropriate values
 * for the arguments \a colSigs and \a colLabels, the isomorphism signatures
 * and triangulation packet labels can be taken from arbitrary
 * columns of the text file.  Columns are considered to be separated by
 * whitespace and are numbered beginning at 0.
 *
 * \i18n This routine makes no assumptions about the
 * \ref i18n "character encoding" used in the given file \e name, and
 * simply passes it through unchanged to low-level C/C++ file I/O routines.
 * It assumes however that the \e contents of the file are in UTF-8.
 *
 * @param filename the name of the text file from which to read.
 * @param dimension must be set to 3, indicating that isomorphism
 * signatures should be expanded into 3-manifold triangulations.
 * This argument is a placeholder for future expansion, and currently no
 * value other than 3 is allowed.
 * @param colSigs the column of the text file containing the
 * isomorphism signatures.
 * @param colLabels the column of the text file containing the
 * triangulation packet labels.  If this is negative then the
 * isomorphism signatures themselves will be used as packet labels.
 * @param ignoreLines the number of lines at the beginning of the text
 * file that should be ignored completely.
 * @return a new container as described above, or 0 if an I/O error occurred
 * whilst reading the given file.
