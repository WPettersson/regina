/**
 * An object through which external interfaces can obtain progress
 * reports when running long calculations.
 * The running calculation writes to this object to
 * store the current state of progress, and the external interface reads
 * from this object from a different thread.
 *
 * When writing progress information to an NProgress object, the last
 * call should be to setFinished().  This informs all threads
 * that the operation is finished and that the NProgress object can be
 * deleted without the risk that the writing thread will attempt to
 * access it again.
 *
 * If the operation allows it, the reading thread
 * may at any time request that the operation be cancelled by calling
 * cancel().  The writing thread should regularly poll isCancelled(),
 * and if it detects a cancellation request should exit cleanly as soon
 * as possible.  Note that the writing thread should still call
 * setFinished() in this situation.
 *
 * NProgress contains multithreading support; a mutex is used to ensure
 * that the reading and writing threads do not interfere.
 * Note that multithreading is in general not supported in the
 * calculation engine, and the second thread must <b>only</b> read the
 * current state of progress and do nothing else.
 *
 * NProgress also contains timing support, with measurements in both
 * real time and CPU time.  See the routines getRealTime() and
 * totalCPUTime() for details.
 *
 * Subclasses of NProgress represent the various ways in which progress
 * can be internally stored.  Note that subclass member functions
 * must lock the mutex whenever internal data is being
 * accessed or modified (see NMutex::MutexLock for how this is done).
 * Any public subclass member function that changes the state of
 * progress must set the \a changed flag to \c true, and all public
 * subclass query functions must set the \a changed flag to \c false.
