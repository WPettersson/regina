/**
 * Represents a permutation of {0,1,2,3}.
 * Amongst other things, such permutations are used in specifying how
 * simplices of a 3-manifold triangulation are glued together.
 * NPerm4 objects are small enough to pass about by value instead of by
 * reference.
 *
 * Each permutation has an internal code, and this code is sufficient to
 * reconstruct the permutation.
 * Thus the internal code may be a useful means for passing
 * permutation objects to and from the engine.
 *
 * The internal permutation codes have changed as of Regina 4.6.1:
 *
 * - \e First-generation codes were used internally in Regina 4.6 and earlier.
 *   These codes were characters whose lowest two bits represented the
 *   image of 0, whose next lowest two bits represented the image of 1,
 *   and so on.  The routines getPermCode(), setPermCode(), fromPermCode()
 *   and isPermCode() continue to work with first-generation codes for
 *   backward compatibility.  Likewise, the XML data file format
 *   continues to use first-generation codes to describe tetrahedron gluings.
 *
 * - \e Second-generation codes are used internally in Regina 4.6.1 and above.
 *   These codes are integers between 0 and 23 inclusive, representing the
 *   index of the permutation in the array NPerm4::S4.  The routines
 *   getPermCode2(), setPermCode2(), fromPermCode2() and isPermCode2()
 *   work with second-generation codes.
 *
 * It is highly recommended that, if you need to work with permutation
 * codes at all, you use second-generation codes where possible.  This
 * is because the first-generation routines incur additional overhead
 * in converting back and forth between the second-generation codes
 * (which are used internally by NPerm4).
