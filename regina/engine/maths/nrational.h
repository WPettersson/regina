 * Represents an arbitrary precision rational number.

 * Infinity (1/0) and undefined (0/0) are catered for.  (-1/0) is considered
 * the same as (1/0), and is represented as (1/0).
 * Any operation involving (0/0) will return (0/0).

 * Since infinity is the same as negative infinity, both infinity plus
 * infinity and infinity minus infinity will return infinity.  Infinity
