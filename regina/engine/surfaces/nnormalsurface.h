/**
 * Stores the vector of a single normal surface in a 3-manifold.
 * The different subclasses of NNormalSurfaceVector use different
 * underlying coordinate systems for the normal solution space.
 * However, the various coordinate retrieval routines will return values
 * that are independent of the underlying coordinate system.  Thus the
 * coordinates of the normal surface in any coordinate system can be
 * determined without knowledge of the specific underlying coordinate
 * system being used.
 *
 * Note that if a mirrored vector class is being used (see
 * NNormalSurfaceVectorMirrored), the vector <b>may not change</b> once
 * the first coordinate lookup routine (such as getTriangleCoord() and
 * the like) has been called.  See
 * NNormalSurfaceVectorMirrored for further explanation.
 *
 * Note that non-compact surfaces (surfaces with infinitely many discs,
 * such as spun-normal surfaces) are allowed; in these cases, the
 * corresponding coordinate lookup routines should return
 * NLargeInteger::infinity where appropriate.
 *
 * All subclasses of NNormalSurfaceVector <b>must</b> have the following
 * properties:
 *
 * - Normal surfaces can be enumerated by intersecting the non-negative
 *   orthant of the underlying vector space with some linear subspace;
 *
 * - Multiplying a normal surface by \a k corresponds to multiplying
 *   the underlying vector by \a k for any non-negative integer \a k.
 *
 * <b>When deriving classes from NNormalSurfaceVector:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A unique constant (static const int) must be added to the class
 *   NNormalSurfaceList to represent the new flavour of coordinate
 *   system.</li>
 *   <li>The file flavourregistry.h must be updated to reflect the new
 *   flavour of coordinate system.</li>
 *   <li>Constructors <tt>class(unsigned length)</tt> and
 *   <tt>class(const NVector<NLargeInteger>& cloneMe)</tt> must be
 *   declared and implemented; these will usually just call the
 *   corresponding superclass constructors.</li>
 *   <li>Virtual functions <tt>NNormalSurfaceVector* clone() const</tt>,
 *   <tt>bool allowsAlmostNormal() const</tt>,
 *   <tt>bool allowsSpun() const</tt> and
 *   <tt>bool allowsOriented()</tt> must be declared but not
 *   implemented.  The registry utilities will take care of their
 *   implementations.</li>
 *   <li>All abstract functions must be implemented.
 *   Note that coordinate functions such as getTriangleCoord() must return the
 *   \e total number of discs of the requested type; if your new coordinate
 *   system adorns discs with extra information (such as orientation) then
 *   your implementation must compute the appropriate sum.</li>
 *   <li>The orientation-specific coordinate functions
 *   getOrientedTriangleCoord() and getOrientedQuadCoord() must be
 *   implemented if your coordinate system supports transverse orientation.
 *   Otherwise you can use the default implementations (which returns zero).

         * The results are returned in a matrix with \a V rows and two
