 *
 *  Normal Surface Filter Registry
 *  ------------------------------
 *
 *
 *    THIS FILE SHOULD BE EDITED EACH TIME A NEW FILTERING CLASS
 *        IS CREATED!
 *
 *    Note that each normal surface filtering class should be a subclass
 *        of NSurfaceFilter.
 *
 *    For each such filtering class there should be a line of the form:
 *
 *        REGISTER_FILTER(id, class, name)
 *
 *    where:
 *        id = the integer ID of the new filtering class.
 *        class = the C++ subclass of NSurfaceFilter being registered.
 *        name = the string (English) name of the corresponding
 *            filtering method.
 *
 *    The appropriate include files should also be placed with full path
 *        and without full path in the appropriate include sections below.
 *
 *    To use the filter registry, simply #include this file.  If you
 *        have not defined __FILTER_REGISTRY_BODY, only the include
 *        sections will be brought in.  If you have defined
 *        __FILTER_REGISTRY_BODY, the include sections will be skipped
 *        and the REGISTER_FILTER lines will be brought in instead.
 *        By suitably defining the macro REGISTER_FILTER before including
 *        this file, you can have these lines do whatever you wish.
 *
 *    If you do #include this file, be sure to #undef both
 *        REGISTER_FILTER and __FILTER_REGISTRY_BODY when you are
 *        finished, so that if --enable-final is being used then these
 *        macros are left undefined for the following files.
 *
 *    Filter IDs:
 *    ----------
 *    When selecting an integer ID for your new filtering class, the
 *        following guidelines should be adhered to:
 *
 *    0-999:      Reserved for use with the official program distribution.
 *    1000-9999:  Reserved for future use.
 *    10000-:     Unreserved.

 *
 *  Each time a new filtering class is created, this filter registry should be
 *  updated.  Instructions regarding how to do this are included in
 *  <i>filterregistry.h</i>, which also contains instructions regarding
 *  how to actually use the filter registry.
 *
 *  See NSurfaceFilter for further details.
