         * Reads a single packet from the specified
         * file and returns a newly created object containing that
         * information.  You may assume that the packet to be read
         * is of the same type as the class in which you are implementing
         * this routine.  The newly created object must also be of this
         * type.
         * 
         * For instance, NTriangulation::readPacket() may assume that
         * the packet is of type NTriangulation, and must return a
         * pointer to a newly created NTriangulation.  Deallocation of the
         * newly created packet is the responsibility of whoever calls
         * this routine.
         *
         * The packet type and label may be assumed to have already been
         * read from the file, and should <b>not</b> be reread.  The
         * readPacket() routine should read exactly what writePacket()
         * writes, and vice versa.
         *
         * \a parent represents the packet which will become the new
         * packet's parent in the tree structure, and may be assumed to
         * have already been read from the file.  This information is
         * for reference only, and does not need to be used.  This
         * routine can either insert or not insert the new packet
         * beneath \a parent in the tree structure as it pleases.  Note
         * however that \a parent will be 0 if the new packet is to
         * become a tree matriarch.
         *
         * This routine is not actually provided for NPacket itself, but
         * must be declared and implemented for every packet subclass that
         * will be instantiated.  Within each such subclass the function
         * must be declared to return a pointer to an object of that
         * subclass.  For instance, NTriangulation::readPacket() must
         * be declared to return an NTriangulation*, not simply an NPacket*.
         *
         * New packet types should make this routine simply return 0
         * since this file format is now obsolete, and older calculation
         * engines will not understand newer packet types anyway.
         *
         * \deprecated For the preferred way to read packets from file, see
         * getXMLReader() and class NXMLPacketReader instead.
         *
         * \pre The given file is open for reading and
         * all above conditions have been satisfied.
