/*********************
 *
 *  Packet Registry
 *  ---------------
 *
 *
 *    THIS FILE SHOULD BE EDITED EACH TIME A NEW PACKET TYPE IS CREATED!
 *
 *    For each packet type there should be a line of the form:
 *
 *        REGISTER_PACKET(class, type, name)
 *
 *    where:
 *        class = the C++ class representing this packet type;
 *        type = the integer ID of the new packet type;
 *        name = the string (English) name of the new packet type.
 *
 *    The appropriate include files should also be placed with full path
 *        and without full path in the appropriate include sections below.
 *
 *    To use the packet registry, simply #include this file.  If you have
 *        not defined __PACKET_REGISTRY_BODY, only the include sections will
 *        be brought in.  If you have defined __PACKET_REGISTRY_BODY, the
 *        include sections will be skipped and the REGISTER_PACKET lines
 *        will be brought in instead.  By suitably defining the macro
 *        REGISTER_PACKET before including this file, you can have these
 *        lines do whatever you wish.
 *
 *    If you do #include this file, be sure to #undef both
 *        REGISTER_PACKET and __PACKET_REGISTRY_BODY when you are
 *        finished, so that if --enable-final is being used then these
 *        macros are left undefined for the following files.
 *
 *    Packet Types:
 *    ------------
 *    When selecting an integer ID for your new packet type, the following
 *        guidelines should be adhered to:
 *
 *    1-999:      Reserved for use with the official program distribution.
 *    1000-9999:  Reserved for future use.
 *    10000-:     Unreserved.
