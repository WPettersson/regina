/**
 * An XML element reader that reads the data for an individual packet.
 *
 * Generally a subclass of NXMLPacketReader will be used to receive and
 * store packets that you care about.  However, if you simply wish to
 * ignore a particular packet (and all of its descendants), you can use
 * class NXMLPacketReader itself for the packet(s) you wish to ignore.
 *
 * Routine getPacket() is used to return the packet that was read; see
 * its documentation for further notes on how the packet should be
 * constructed.
 *
 * Routines startSubElement() and endSubElement() should \e not be
 * overridden by derived classes.  They determine whether the subelement
 * is another packet element or a packet tag; if so then they deal with
 * the subelement themselves (packet elements will be read using a new
 * NXMLPacketReader of the correct type), and if not then they call
 * startContentSubElement() and endContentSubElement() which \e should
 * be overridden for processing of non-packet XML subelements.
 *
 * If routine abort() is overridden, it \e must at some point call
 * NXMLPacketReader::abort() which will destroy whatever new packets
 * have already been created.
 *
 * \ifacespython Not present.
