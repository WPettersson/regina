/**
 * Data type that deals with all the detailed homological information in a
 * manifold.  This information includes:
 *
 * - the manifold's homology;
 * - the boundary's homology;
 * - the map from boundary -> manifold;
 * - the dual cellular homology;
 * - the isomorphism on H1 from the dual cellular homology to the regular
 *   cellular homology;
 * - the H1 torsion form;
 * - the Kawauchi-Kojima invariants of torsion linking forms.
 *
 * This class takes a "least effort" approach to all computations. It
 * only computes what is neccessary for your requests.  It also keeps a
 * record of all previous computations you've made. If a computation can
 * be sped up by not recomputing some data, it takes that short-cut.
 *
 * All these algorithms use two transverse CW decompositions of the manifold.
 * They correspond to the (possibly ideal) triangulation native to Regina, 
 * and the dual polyhedral (CW) decomposition which appears in Seifert and
 * Threlfall's textbook.
 *
 * In the following lists we describe the canonical ordering of both the
 * cells and the dual cells of the given triangulation.
 *
 * First we list the cell orderings for the <i>standard CW decomposition</i>,
 * which most closely resembles the ideal triangulation.
 *
 * - \b 0-cells: The non-ideal vertices given in the order vertices.begin()
 *               to vertices.end(), followed by the ideal endpoints of the
 *               edges edges.begin() to edges.end() with endpoints
 *               for each edge taken in the order 0,1.
 *
 * - \b 1-cells: edges.begin() to edges.end(), followed by the ideal edges of
 *               faces.begin() to faces.end() in order 0,1,2.
 *
 * - \b 2-cells: faces.begin() to faces.end(), followed by the ideal faces of
 *               tetrahedra.begin() through tetrahedra.end() in order 0,1,2,3.
 *
 * - \b 3-cells: tetrahedra.begin() through tetrahedra.end().
 *
 * Next we list the cell orderings for the <i>dual CW decomposition</i>:
 * if the standard CW decomposition came from a morse function \a f, this
 * would be the one for -\a f.
 *
 * - \b 0-cells: tetrahedra.begin() through tetrahedra.end().
 *
 * - \b 1-cells: the non-boundary faces.begin() through faces.end().
 *
 * - \b 2-cells: the non-boundary edges.begin() through edges.end().
 *
 * - \b 3-cells: the non-boundary, non-ideal vertices.begin() through
 *               vertices.end().
 *
 * \deprecated This class will be removed in Regina 5.0.  A new and more
 * flexible class called NCellularData will take its place.
