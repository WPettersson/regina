Regina Python Library Directory
-------------------------------

This directory contains some examples of Python libraries.

To activate these libraries with Regina, you can either:

- open Regina's preferences, bring up the Python options, and add these
  files into your list of active Python libraries;

- type the full names of these files directly into ~/.regina-libs ,
  one file per line.

Each time you start a Python session (either in the user interface or
through the command-line tool "regina-python"), Regina will automatically
run all of the code in your active libraries before handing you control.
This means that all of the functions defined in these libraries will be
available to you.

See the users' handbook for more information on Python scripting and
Python libraries.
