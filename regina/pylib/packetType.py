# Regina - A Normal Surface Theory Calculator
# Python Helper Routines
#
# Copyright (c) 2002-2011, Ben Burton
# For further details contact Ben Burton (bab@debian.org).
#
# Usage:
#
#     The helper routines in this file offer a quick way of telling whether
#     a given packet is of a particular type.
#
#     To automatically load these routines into every new Regina python
#     session, add this file to your list of active python libraries
#     under Regina's python settings.  Alternatively, you can add this
#     file directly as a new line to ~/.regina-libs .
#
#     Each routine is documented using standard python docstrings, which
#     means you can access this documentation from within python at runtime:
#
#         >>> from pydoc import help
#         >>> help(isTriangulation)
#
#         Help on function isTriangulation in module __main__:
#
#         isTriangulation(packet)
#             Is the given packet a 3-manifold triangulation?
#             ...
