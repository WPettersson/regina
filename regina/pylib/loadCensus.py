# Regina - A Normal Surface Theory Calculator
# Python Helper Routines
#
# Copyright (c) 2007-2011, Ben Burton
# For further details contact Ben Burton (bab@debian.org).
#
# Usage:
#
#     The helper routines in this file give python users easy access to
#     some of Regina's prepackaged census data files.
#
#     To automatically load these routines into every new Regina python
#     session, add this file to your list of active python libraries
#     under Regina's python settings.  Alternatively, you can add this
#     file directly as a new line to ~/.regina-libs .
#
#     Each routine is documented using standard python docstrings, which
#     means you can access this documentation from within python at runtime:
#
#         >>> from pydoc import help
#         >>> help(loadClosedNorCensus)
#
#         Help on function loadClosedNorCensus in module __main__:
#
#         loadClosedNorCensus(minTet=1, maxTet=11)
#             Loads the census of closed non-orientable minimal P^2-irreducible
#             triangulations, as tabulated by Burton and shipped with Regina.
#             ...

    Loads the census of closed orientable prime minimal triangulations,
    as tabulated by Burton and shipped with Regina.

    This census can be accessed directly from within Regina by selecting
    "File -> Open Example -> Closed Orientable Census (Large)".

    If the optional minTet / maxTet arguments are given, this routine
    will strip out all triangulations whose tetrahedron count lies
    outside the inclusive range [minTet, maxTet].

    10-tetrahedron (large) censuses shipped with Regina.  An 11-tetrahedron
    census (which is too large to ship) can be downloaded separately from
    http://regina.sourceforge.net/data.html .
