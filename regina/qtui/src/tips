Each piece of information stored in a topology data file is called a
<i>packet</i>.  There are many different types of packets: containers,
triangulations, normal surface lists, text items and more.
<p>
Packets are arranged in a tree (displayed on the left hand side of the
main window), so each packet may store several other &quot;child packets&quot;
beneath it.  This allows you to keep large amounts of data together in a
single file in an organised fashion.

<p>
Changes that you make to a packet (such as a triangulation, a text
packet, a script, etc.) do not take effect until you commit them.
<p>
To commit your changes, press the <i>Commit</i> button at the bottom of
the packet editor.  If you close the packet editor or press the
<i>Discard</i> button, any changes since the last commit will be
discarded (you will be warned before this happens).
<p>
Note that some actions automatically commit your changes for you (such
as barycentric subdivision, or simplifying a triangulation).

Have you looked at the Regina Handbook?
<p>
Regina comes with a rich users' handbook, full of screen shots,
which walks you through the many different things you can do.
If you are looking for something in particular, try the index at the back.
<p>
You can read the handbook by selecting
<i>Help&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Regina Handbook</i> from the menu, or just press F1.

Regina ships with several example files that you can play with
to see what Regina can do.  The file <tt>sample-misc.rga</tt> is an
excellent starting point.
<p>
You can access most of these files through the
<i>File&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Open Example</i> menu.

Most user interface elements in Regina come with &quot;what's this&quot;
help.
<p>
To find out what a button, text box, list, menu item, etc. does,
select <i>What's This?</i> from the <i>Help</i> menu and click on whatever
object you are curious about.

If you wish to remember what role a tetrahedron plays within a
triangulation, you can name it.
In the <i>Gluings</i> tab of the triangulation editor, just type a
name for your tetrahedron directly into the leftmost column of the table.

If you find it difficult to search through long lists of normal surfaces,
you can create a <i>surface filter</i>.  A surface filter lets you
restrict your view to only those surfaces with certain properties
(for instance, all closed orientable surfaces with Euler characteristic zero).
<p>
To create a new surface filter, select
<i>Packet Tree&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;New Filter</i> from the menu, and then
select <i>Filter by properties</i> in the dialog that appears.

Once a triangulation has a normal surface list or angle structure
list beneath it, the triangulation cannot be changed (since this
would invalidate the normal surfaces and angle structures).
<p>
If you wish to edit such a triangulation, try cloning it through the
<i>Packet Tree</i> menu.  The clone will not have any children beneath
it, and you can edit it freely.

<p>
If you wish to mark a particular normal surface within a list so that
you can find it again later, you can give it a name.
<p>
Simply type your name directly into the <i>Name</i> column of the
table of surfaces.  Don't forget to commit your changes!

Regina ships with several command-line utilities for manipulating data
files and running long census calculations.  See the
<i>Specialised Utilities</i> section of the Regina Handbook for details.

If you use Regina's python interface and you find yourself writing the same
code over and over again, you can put this code in a <i>python library</i>.
<p>
A python library is simply a text file (usually containing function
definitions) that is executed at the beginning of each python session.
<p>
To add a new python library, simply open Regina's settings,
select <i>Python Options</i> and add your file to the list.

You can embed PDF documents directly into Regina data files.  This
allows you to document your work using not just plain text but also
diagrams and typeset equations.
<p>
To do this, create your PDF document using your favourite word processor
or typesetting system (such as LaTeX).  Then select <i>New PDF Document</i>
from the <i>Packet Tree</i> menu, where you can browse the filesystem and
import your PDF document into the current Regina data file.

Whenever you are using a text editor (e.g., when editing a text packet or a
script packet), all of the usual editor shortcuts are available to you.
<p>
For instance, you can paste using
<b>Ctrl-V</b> (or <b>&#8984;-V</b> on a mac),
and you can undo using
<b>Ctrl-Z</b> (or <b>&#8984;-Z</b> on a mac).

The isomorphism signature for a triangulation, as well as the
Callahan-Hildebrand-Weeks dehydration string (if it exists),
will be shown in the <i>Composition</i> tab of the triangulation
viewer.
<p>
You can copy these strings to the clipboard by selecting the
corresponding line of text in the composition tab, and then
selecting <i>Edit&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Copy</i> from the menu.

You can export a section of your packet tree into its own separate data
file.  Select the root of the subtree that you wish to export, and then
select <i>File&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Export&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Regina Data File</i>
from the menu.  Make sure that the correct subtree is selected
in the dialog that appears, then press <i>OK</i>.

You can combine several surface filters using boolean AND or OR.
This is done using <i>combination filters</i>.
<p>
Select <i>Packet Tree&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;New Filter</i> from the menu, and then
select <i>Combination filter</i> in the diagog that appears.
This filter will combine all of the filters <i>immediately beneath it</i>
in the packet tree.
<p>
So, for instance, to create a filter that restricts your view to just
spheres and tori, create a new combination filter that uses boolean OR.
Beneath this combination filter, create two property filters: one that captures
closed orientable surfaces with Euler characteristic two, and one that
captures closed orientable surfaces with Euler characteristic zero.

Finding it hard to read embedded PDF documents?  If your Regina window
is small and you are using the embedded PDF viewer, you
might find that space is limited and the PDF shrinks to a very small size.
<p>
If you click inside the PDF, you will see Okular's own buttons
and menu items.  You can zoom in and out, or create more space by hiding
the side navigation panel (hit <b>F7</b> or see the <i>Settings</i> menu).
<p>
If you want the PDF in a window of its own, press the
paper clip in the top-right corner of the packet viewer to undock it.
Alternatively, you can configure Regina to open all PDFs in a separate
application: in Regina's <i>PDF Options</i> panel, uncheck
<i>"Use embedded viewer if possible"</i>.
