 <title>Data File Format</title>

 <partintro>
  <para>
   Since &regina; version 3.0, data files are now saved in an optionally
   compressed &xml; format.  If a data file is compressed, it can be piped
   through <command>gunzip</command> to recover the plain text &xml;.
  </para>
  <para>
   This reference chapter documents the various &xml; elements that form
   a &regina; data file and how they are used.  The top-level element
   for a data file is &xml-reginadata;.
  </para>
  <para>
   Regarding international characters:
   As of &regina; version &utf8intro;, all &xml; data is encoded using &utf8;
   (which includes plain &ascii; as a subset).  In versions 4.4 and earlier,
   data was encoded in &latin1; without declaring this explicitly in the
   &xml; header; &regina; is aware of this, and treats all older
   data files as &latin1; when they are loaded.
