User handbook and file format reference
---------------------------------------

regina/ - User handbook
regina-xml/ - XML file format reference

These user references are written in KDE's XML docbook format.

Regarding ksgmltools/:

  The directory ksgmltools2/ contains a stripped-down version of the KDE
  docbook files so that we can build the documentation using just xsltproc,
  without a full KDE installation and without KDE-specific tools such as
  meinproc).  These files were taken from kdelibs 4.4.1.  See
  ksgmltools2/LICENSE and ksgmltools2/docbook/xsl/README for licensing.

  All localisation/translation support has been removed from this copy,
  in order to keep the copy of ksgmltools2/ as small as possible.  If
  you wish to translate these documents, please mail the Regina
  developers and we can re-add the supporting files for your language.
