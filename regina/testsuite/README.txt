Regina C++ Test Suite
---------------------

This directory tree contains the sources for the C++ calculation engine
test suite.  The test suite can be used to verify that Regina is operating
correctly under different compilers or on different platforms.

To build and run the test suite, move to the top-level build directory
and type: make test ARGS=-V

See also the python test suite in ../python/testsuite/.
