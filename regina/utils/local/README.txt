Regina Local Utilities Directory
--------------------------------

This directory contains miscellaneous command-line utilities that are
not intended for final installation.  They are not built by default, and
they are not included in binary packages for Regina.

These utilities are not installed because they are highly specialised
for the author's needs, and are unlikely to be of wider interest.

Nevertheless, they are included here in the source code repository for
completeness (and for better revision control).
