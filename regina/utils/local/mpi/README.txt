Regina Local MPI Utilities Directory
------------------------------------

As with the parent directory regina/utils/local/, this directory
contains miscellaneous command-line utilities that are not intended for
final installation.  The utilities in this subdirectory make use of
MPI (the Message Passing Interface, used for parallel computation).

Like the parent directory regina/utils/local/, these utilities are not
built by default and are not included in binary packages for Regina.
See ../README.txt for further information.
