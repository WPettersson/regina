/**
 * The given topology data file is read.
 *
 * It is assumed that triangulations in the data file are grouped into
 * containers, with each container representing different triangulations
 * of the same 3-manifold.
 *
 * For each container, the triangulations are examined one by one until
 * a 3-manifold can be recognised.  If so, the name of the 3-manifold is
 * output alongside the name of the container, and no further
 * triangulations for that container are examined.  If none of its
 * triangulations are recognised, the word UNKNOWN is output alongside
 * the container instead.
 *
 * If the option -d is passed, more detailed names will be given to
 * 3-manifolds (e.g., simpler quotient spaces will be named according to
 * their full Seifert structures).
 *
 * If the option -o is passed, the original file will be overwritten
 * with any changes that were made.  Otherwise output will be written to
 * the console only.
 *
 * If the option -r is passed, container packets will be renamed
 * according to the newly discovered 3-manifold names.
 *
 * If the option -s is passed, container packets will be sorted (within
 * their respective parent containers) according to the underlying
 * 3-manifold.  The method of ordering 3-manifolds is subject to change;
 * currently it bears some resemblance to the ordering used by Martelli
 * and Petronio in their tables of closed orientable 3-manifolds.
 *
 * If the option -w is passed, a raw list of manifolds and homology
 * groups (where they can be calculated) will be output.  Each manifold
 * that cannot be recognised will be written on its own line as "UNKNOWN".
 * This option may not be used with any of the other options listed above.
