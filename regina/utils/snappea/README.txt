Regina SnapPea Utilities Directory
----------------------------------

This directory contains command-line utilities that link against SnapPea.

On most systems the SnapPea code is not available as a shared library.
Therefore these utilities are not built by default, and they are not
included in binary packages for Regina.

They were in fact designed for use by the author in preparing the
census data files found in Regina's examples directory.  They are
included here in the source distribution for completeness.
