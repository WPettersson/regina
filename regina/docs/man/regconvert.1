.SH NAME
regconvert \- Convert between different Regina file formats
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBregconvert\fR [ \fB-x\fR | \fB-u\fR | \fB-b\fR ] \fB\fIold-file\fB\fR [ \fB\fInew-file\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Between Regina versions 2.4 and 3.0, the data files changed from
using an impenetrable and undocumented binary format to using
(optionally compressed) XML\&.
.PP
This utility converts back and forth between these different
file formats.
.PP
The argument \fIold-file\fR should be the file to
read and convert; the argument \fInew-file\fR should
be the name of the new converted file to write.  These two filenames
may be the same, in which case the old file will be replaced with the new.
.PP
If the argument \fInew-file\fR is missing then the
new file will be written to standard output, which forces the output to be
uncompressed XML (see option \fB-u\fR).
.sp
.RS
.B "Warning:"
When writing an old-style binary file, some information might be
lost.  Old-style binary files can only store information that was
understood by the old version Regina\~2.4.
