Regina Documentation Directory
------------------------------

This directory tree is used to generate man pages and API documentation.

The man pages are extracted from the Regina handbook, which is located
in ../qtui/doc/regina/.

The API documentation is generated via doxygen from the extensive
comments throughout the source code.
