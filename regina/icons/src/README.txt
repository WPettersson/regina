Regina Image Source Directory
-----------------------------

This directory tree contains the original source files used to produce
various images and icons.  If you need to resize or regenerate an icon,
these source files are generally the best starting point.


ATTRIBUTIONS:

The packet_pdf icon is based on the pdf mimetype icon shipped with kdelibs.

The x-regina mimetype icon incorporates the generic "sheet of paper" from
the oxygen icon set.
