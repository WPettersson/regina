# Roughly analyses various properties of the current python bindings.
#
# For each C++ source file containing python bindings for Regina, a line
# will be output specifying whether boost::noncopyable or std::auto_ptr
# is used anywhere within this file.
#
# This script is dependent upon the specific structure of the Regina
# python bindings and is only intended for use by the developers of
# these bindings.
