Regina Python Test Suite
------------------------

This directory tree contains the test suite for Regina's python interface.
The test suite can be used to verify that Regina's python bindings are
operating correctly under different compilers or on different platforms.

To build and run the test suite, move to the top-level build directory
and type: make test ARGS=-V

See also the C++ test suite in ../../testsuite/.
