0 0 --- Empty triangulation
0 0 --- L(8,3)
0 0 --- RP2 x S1
0 0 --- Solid Klein bottle
0 0 --- LST(3,4,7)
1 1 --- Solid ball
1 0 --- Figure eight knot complement
2 0 --- Whitehead link complement
1 0 --- Gieseking manifold
2 -1 --- Cusped genus two torus
-1 1 --- Invalid edge
1 1 --- Two projective plane cusps
1 0 --- Pinched solid torus
1 0 --- Pinched solid Klein bottle
