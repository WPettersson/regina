Building the MacOS bundle:

The runtime bundle stands alone, but to build you still need fink installed.
Build-dependencies include:

  boost1.46.1.cmake
  cmake
  cppunit1.12.1
  doxygen
  gmp5
  libsource-highlight4
  libxml2
  libxslt-bin
  popt

  qt4-base-mac (for i386), or Nokia's standalone Qt install (for x86_64)

To configure:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/install/location
    -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python
    -DREGINA_INSTALL_TYPE=Bundle
	-DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=path/to/QtSDK/Desktop/Qt/4.8.0/gcc/bin/qmake
	..

Then:

  make
  make test ARGS=-V
  make install

At this point the bundle Regina.app should be ready in the install location.
