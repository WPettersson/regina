DescPackaging: <<
Although the upstream application is called regina, this package is called
regina-normal to avoid confusion with regina the REXX interpreter.
.
The API for the shared library libregina-engine changes significantly with
each release, and so the upstream version number is part of the soname.
This means that the names of the -shlibs and -dev splitoffs change with
each upstream release also.

DescDetail: <<
Regina is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists.
It focuses on the study of 3-manifold triangulations and normal surfaces.
.
Other highlights of Regina include angle structures, census enumeration,
combinatorial recognition of triangulations, and high-level tasks such
as 3-sphere recognition and connected sum decomposition.  Regina comes
with a full graphical user interface, and also offers Python bindings
and a low-level C++ programming interface.
.
This package includes the graphical user interface and the command-line
Python interface, as well as the users' reference manual and the
Python reference (i.e., the API documentation for the Regina
calculation engine).
<<
DescUsage: <<
The main graphical user interface is shipped in the KDE app bundle
%p/opt/kde4/%type_pkg[kde]/bin/regina-kde .  If you like you can drag
this onto your dock.
.
Regina also installs several command-line utilities in
%p/opt/kde4/%type_pkg[kde]/bin, so you might like to put this directory
on your default search path.  To start a command-line Python session, run
%p/opt/kde4/%type_pkg[kde]/bin/regina-python.
.
To get started, run the graphical user interface (regina-kde) and take a
look at the Regina Handbook (Help->Regina Handbook from the menu), or open
one of the sample data files and have a play (File->Open Examples).
.
If you wish to use Regina's C++ mathematical engine in your own code,
install the package regina-normal%v-dev.

Complete API documentation can be found in the package regina-normal.
Look in the directory
%p/opt/kde4/%type_pkg[kde]/share/regina-normal/engine-docs/, or run the
graphical user interface and select Help->Python API Reference from the menu
(which describes the C++ API as well).
