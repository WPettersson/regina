Notes for setting up GNU/Linux installations
--------------------------------------------

This list of notes is simply to help the author build packages for Regina
on many different GNU/Linux distributions without forgetting anything.

For each new installation:

  1. Verify installation:

    - Grub on the MBR should have a corresponding entry;
    - uname -a should report the correct architecture;
    - /etc/issue should report the correct distribution.

  2. Install software:

    - Install build dependencies;
    - Install graphviz;
    - Install kig or kdeedu;
    - Ensure that /usr/bin/rpmbuild exists.

  3. Make at least 1.2 GB of free disk space.

Distribution-specific caveats for the author's machine:

  - FC8 needs the nopcmcia option when installed.
  - Ubuntu gutsy needs to install in safe graphics mode, and needs
    grub to boot with options vga=791 nosplash.
  - Ubuntu feisty needs to install from the alternate CD, and needs
    options vga=791 nosplash.
  - Mandriva 2008.0 needs sound disabled.

If you are interested in helping package Regina for one or more
distributions, please contact the author at the address below.
