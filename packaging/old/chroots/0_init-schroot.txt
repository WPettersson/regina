Host debian system:  Initial schroot setup
------------------------------------------

This details the initial steps for setting up schroot on the host debian
system.  These steps need to be performed before any chroots are created.

Please see the distribution-specific information files (such as
5_ubuntu.txt or 5_mandriva.txt) for full instructions on setting up a
chroot for building and testing regina.


Assumptions
-----------

- The host system is running debian lenny (amd64).


Host schroot configuration
--------------------------

- Install schroot.

- Edit /etc/schroot/mount-defaults to mount host /home as guest /home/master,
  to avoid mixing configurations for different versions of software:

  (/etc/schroot/mount-defaults, line 9:)
  - /home           /home           none    rw,bind         0       0
  + /home           /home/master    none    rw,bind         0       0

- Create a new file /etc/schroot/copyfiles-rpm that only copies network
  configuration, not users and groups:

  (/etc/schroot/copyfiles-rpm, entire file:)
  /etc/hosts
  /etc/resolv.conf

  Note that the files removed from copyfiles-defaults were /etc/group,
  /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.

- Copy /etc/schroot/script-defaults to a new script /etc/schroot/script-rpm,
  and edit this new script to source copyfiles-rpm:

  (/etc/schroot/script-rpm, line 8:)
  - COPYFILES="/etc/schroot/copyfiles-defaults"
  + COPYFILES="/etc/schroot/copyfiles-rpm"

  This new script will be used with RPM-based systems (where we do not
  want to clobber user/group information).  The original script-defaults
  will be used with debian-based systems.
