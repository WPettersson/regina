Documentation for setting up GNU/Linux distributions in chroots
---------------------------------------------------------------

The various text files in this directory document what I've done on my
debian lenny system to set up several different chroots with several
different "guest" GNU/Linux distributions, with the specific aim of
packaging Regina for these distributions.

These notes are *not* in any way meant to be general instructions for
arbitrary people doing arbitrary things in chroots.  Much better general
instructions can be found on the web.  These documents are tailored
specifically to my personal setup, and are intended purely as a reminder
to myself in case I get a new machine and need to do this all over
again.

If you are interested in helping package Regina for one or more
distributions, please contact the author at the address below.
