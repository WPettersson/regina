Setting up fedora chroots under debian lenny (amd64)
----------------------------------------------------

This file documents what I've done on my debian lenny system to set up
i386 and x86_64 chroots in which I can build and test fedora packages
for regina.

These notes are tailored specifically to my own setup, and are not
intended for general use.  See NOTES.txt for further information.

TODO: A note should be added on disabling ccache on the guest system.


System layout
-------------

- Unless otherwise specified, all work is done under debian lenny
  (the "host debian system").

- A standalone fedora installation (the "host fedora system") is
  installed on its own separate partition (currently 4G and 75% full).
  This is mounted within the host debian system in /srv/chroot/fchost.

  The host fedora system is used purely for calling mock to bootstrap
  the various fedora chroots.  At the time of writing it runs fedora 10
  (x86_64) but this may be upgraded from time to time.

- /srv/chroot/fedora is a directory on the host debian system containing
  one subdirectory for each final fedora chroot (the "guest fedora systems").
  This area is mounted from a separate partition (currently 20G, and only
  about 60% full).  Each subdirectory is managed by mock, and the chroot
  filesystems live within root/ inside each of these subdirectories.


Host debian system configuration (debian lenny)
-----------------------------------------------

- Follow the steps described in 0_init-schroot.txt to set up schroot on
  the host debian system.

- Mount the guest fedora partition as /srv/chroot/fedora, and mount
  the host fedora partition as /srv/chroot/fchost:

  (from /etc/fstab:)
  LABEL=/fedora /srv/chroot/fedora ext3 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 0
  LABEL=/fchost /srv/chroot/fchost ext3 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 0

- Create a new fstab file /etc/schroot/mount-fedora, which consists of
  the standard /etc/schroot/mount-defaults plus the following extra line:

  /srv/chroot/fedora /var/lib/mock none rw,bind 0 0

- Create a new schroot script /etc/schroot/script-fedora, which is a
  copy of /etc/schroot/script-rpm but which uses the new fstab file:

  (/etc/schroot/script-fedora, line 5:)
  - FSTAB="/etc/schroot/mount-defaults"
  + FSTAB="/etc/schroot/mount-fedora"

- Add a schroot entry for the fedora host, which will only be used as root:

  [fchost]
  type=directory
  description=Fedora chroot host
  location=/srv/chroot/fchost
  priority=3
  root-users=root
  run-setup-scripts=true
  run-exec-scripts=true
  script-config=script-fedora


Host fedora system configuration
--------------------------------

- After installing the host fedora system, make SELinux disabled by default.
  Otherwise schroot can mess with the SELinux file labellings and render the
  host system unbootable.

  (from /etc/selinux/config:)
  SELINUX=disabled

- Ensure that the host fedora system has the correct filesystem label:

  debian# e2label /dev/sda10 /fchost

- Chroot into the host fedora system and ensure that mock is installed:

  debian# schroot -c fchost yum install mock


Guest fedora system configuration
-----------------------------------

- Enter the fedora host in order to bootstrap the guest system:

  debian# schroot -c fchost

- Locate the relevant config file in /etc/mock/:

  fchost# ls /etc/mock
  ...
  fedora-7-i386.cfg
  fedora-7-x86_64.cfg
  ...

- Comment out the updates repository from this config file:

  (from /etc/mock/fedora-13-x86_64.cfg:)
  # [updates-released]
  # name=updates
  # mirrorlist=...
  # ...

- If necessary, point the base repository to a desirable mirror:

  (from /etc/mock/fedora-13-x86_64.cfg:)
  [fedora]
  ...
  # mirrorlist=...
  baseurl=http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/fedora/linux/releases/13/Everything/x86_64/os/
  ...

- Set up a base graphical system:

  fchost# mock -r fedora-7-x86_64 --init
  fchost# mock -r fedora-7-x86_64 --install yum man kdelibs kdebase (on <= fc8)
  fchost# mock -r fedora-7-x86_64 --install yum man kdelibs kdebase
                                            kdebase-workspace       (on >= fc9)

- Edit the guest yum configuration to (i) disable updates, and (ii) output
  useful information during download and installation:

  (from /var/lib/mock/fedora-7-x86_64/root/etc/yum.conf:)
  ...
  debuglevel=2
  ...
  # [updates-released]
  # name=updates
  # mirrorlist=
  ...

  (from /var/lib/mock/fedora-7-x86_64/root/etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates.repo:)
  enabled=0

- Verify that only the main repository is enabled:

  fchost# grep enabled=1 /var/lib/mock/fedora-7-x86_64/root/etc/yum.repos.d/*
  /var/lib/mock/fedora-7-x86_64/root/etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo:enabled=1

- Add a schroot entry in the debian host system:

  [fc7-x86_64]
  type=directory
  description=Fedora 7 (x86_64)
  location=/srv/chroot/fedora/fedora-7-x86_64/root
  priority=3
  users=bab
  root-users=root
  run-setup-scripts=true
  run-exec-scripts=true
  script-config=script-rpm

  (for x86_64 chroots:)
  aliases=fc7

  (for i386 chroots:)
  personality=linux32

- Enter the guest fedora system to continue the installation:

  debian# schroot -c fc7-x86_64

- Rebuild the RPM database in the format expected by the guest system
  (rather than the fedora host system):

  fcguest# rm /var/lib/rpm/__db.*
  fcguest# rpm --rebuilddb

- Double-check again that no updates are enabled:

  fcguest# yum repolist

- Install useful utilities, embedded X servers and some basic fonts:

  fcguest# yum install patchutils rootfiles vim-enhanced wget zsh
                       xdg-utils kde-settings
  fcguest# yum install xorg-x11-server-{Xorg,Xnest,Xephyr} vnc-server
                       xorg-x11-fonts-{truetype,100dpi,misc,Type1}

- Install packages for building and running regina:

  fcguest# yum install rpmlint boost-devel cppunit-devel doxygen gmp-devel
                       libselinux-devel libxml2-devel python-devel zlib-devel

  fcguest# yum install popt              (on <= fc7)
  fcguest# yum install popt-devel        (on >= fc8)

  fcguest# yum install kdelibs-devel qt-devel            (on <= fc8)
  fcguest# yum install kdelibs3-devel qt3-devel kdebase3 (on >= fc9)

  fcguest# yum install kdegraphics graphviz
  fcguest# yum install kdeedu (on <= fc9)
  fcguest# yum install kdeedu-math (on >= fc10)

- Symlink /bin/zsh to /usr/bin/zsh:

  fcguest# ln -s /bin/zsh /usr/bin/zsh

- Manually add an ordinary user:

  fcguest# groupadd -g 1000 bab
  fcguest# useradd -u 1000 -g 1000 bab

- Follow the final steps described in 9_final-guestuser.txt to start a
  chrooted session.
