Setting up a sid chroot under debian lenny
------------------------------------------

This file documents what I've done on my debian lenny system to set up a
chroot in which I can build and test packages for regina under debian
unstable (otherwise known as sid).

These notes are tailored specifically to my own setup, and are not
intended for general use.  See NOTES.txt for further information.

This file was created on 31 January 2008.  Since sid is a fast-moving
target, these instructions might need changing as time goes by.


System layout
-------------

- All work is done under debian lenny (the "host system").

- /srv/chroot/sid is the chroot directory on the host system containing
  debian sid (the "guest system").  This is mounted from a separate
  partition (currently 10G and only about 20% full at the time of writing).


Host (debian lenny) configuration
---------------------------------

- Follow the steps described in 0_init-schroot.txt to set up schroot on
  the host debian system.

- Install debootstrap.

- Mount the sid partition as /srv/chroot/sid:

  (from /etc/fstab:)
  LABEL=/sid /srv/chroot/sid ext3 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 0


Guest (debian sid) configuration
--------------------------------

- Bootstrap the system:

  lenny# debootstrap sid /srv/chroot/sid http://ftp.iinet.net.au/debian/debian/

- Create guest home directory:

  lenny# mkdir /srv/chroot/sid/home/bab
  lenny# chown bab.bab /srv/chroot/sid/home/bab

- Add a schroot entry:

  [sid]
  type=directory
  description=Debian sid (unstable)
  location=/srv/chroot/sid
  priority=3
  users=bab
  root-users=root
  run-setup-scripts=true
  run-exec-scripts=true

- Install basic graphical system:

  lenny# schroot -c sid aptitude install
         less vim zsh kdelibs kdebase kdebase-workspace xnest xserver-xephyr

- Stop host processes that conflict with the guest install:

  This presumably depends on the current state of debian sid; on the
  31 January install it was only the dbus process that needed stopping.

- Install packages necessary for building regina:

  lenny# schroot -c sid aptitude install
         build-essential devscripts fakeroot lintian
         automake1.9 debhelper doxygen kdelibs4-dev libboost-python-dev
         libcppunit-dev libgmp3-dev libmpich1.0-dev libpopt-dev
         libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev
  lenny# schroot -c sid aptitude clean

- Install other packages useful for running and testing regina:

  lenny# schroot -c sid aptitude install gap graphviz okular kig mpich-bin
  lenny# schroot -c sid aptitude clean

- Follow the final steps described in 9_final-guestuser.txt to start a
  chrooted session.
