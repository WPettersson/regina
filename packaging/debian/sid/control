Description: software for 3-manifold topology and normal surfaces
 Regina is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists.
 It focuses on the study of 3-manifold triangulations and normal surfaces.
 .
 Other highlights of Regina include angle structures, census enumeration,
 combinatorial recognition of triangulations, and high-level tasks such
 as 3-sphere recognition and connected sum decomposition.  Regina comes
 with a full graphical user interface, and also offers Python bindings
 and a low-level C++ programming interface.
 .
 This package includes the graphical user interface and the command-line
 Python interface.  The users' handbook and the API documentation are in
 the separate package regina-normal-doc, and the MPI-enabled utilities for
 high-performance clusters are in the separate package regina-normal-mpi.

Description: development files for Regina, the 3-manifold topology software
 Regina is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists.
 This package provides development files for compiling Regina's mathematical
 engine into other projects.
 .
 The calculation engine is provided as a C++ shared library.  For complete
 API documentation, see the package regina-normal-doc.

Description: MPI utilities for Regina, the 3-manifold topology software
 Regina is a suite of mathematical software for 3-manifold topologists.
 This package contains the components of Regina designed to run large
 parallel computations on a high-performance cluster using MPI.
 .
 These components are built against the default implementation of MPI,
 and must be run under the default MPI runtime environment (as found
 in the package mpi-default-bin).
 .
 Regina focuses on the study of 3-manifold triangulations and normal
 surfaces.  Other highlights include angle structures, census enumeration,
