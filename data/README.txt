Additional Supporting Data for Regina
-------------------------------------

This directory contains supporting data files that (for whatever reason)
are not included within the main source repository.

This includes extremely large census data files, which cannot feasibly
be shipped with Regina itself (instead users must download them separately
from the Regina website).

Please note that most of the supporting data for Regina is *not* found here;
instead see the main Regina source tree (in particular, the regina/examples/
directory).
