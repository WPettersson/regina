Regina Raw Signature Directory
------------------------------

This directory contains a census of splitting surface signatures as
generated by Regina.

These are plain text files containing all splitting surface signatures
of a given order.  Each individual signature is written on a separate line.

For brevity, brackets are omitted and cycles are separated by periods.
For instance, the signature '(aab)(bc)(c)' is written as 'aab.bc.c'.
